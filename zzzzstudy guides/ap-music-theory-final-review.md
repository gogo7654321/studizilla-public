```

### Dictation Strategies

```
MELODIC DICTATION:

1. FIRST HEARING
   - Identify key and meter
   - Note overall contour
   - Find phrase endings

2. SECOND HEARING
   - Write structural pitches
   - Mark strong beats
   - Note difficult spots

3. THIRD HEARING
   - Fill in details
   - Check rhythm
   - Verify intervals

4. CHECK
   - Sing back internally
   - Verify beat alignment
   - Count measures

HARMONIC DICTATION:

1. LISTEN FOR BASS
   - Root motion pattern
   - Cadences

2. IDENTIFY CHORD QUALITY
   - Major or minor?
   - Seventh chord?

3. LABEL FUNCTION
   - Tonic, dominant, etc.
   - Roman numerals
```

## ✍️ Written Skills Summary

### Part Writing Rules

```
VOICE LEADING:

DO:
- Keep common tones
- Move by step when possible
- Move contrary to bass
- Resolve tendency tones

DON'T:
- Parallel 5ths or 8ves
- Voice crossing
- Large leaps (usually)
- Doubled leading tone

SPACING:
- S-A: ≤ octave
- A-T: ≤ octave
- T-B: can be larger
```

### Figured Bass Realization

```
FIGURED BASS SYMBOLS:

5/3 or nothing = Root position
6 or 6/3 = 1st inversion
6/4 = 2nd inversion

For 7th chords:
7 = Root position
6/5 = 1st inversion
4/3 = 2nd inversion
4/2 = 3rd inversion

ACCIDENTALS:
♯, ♭, ♮ alone = apply to 3rd
♯6, ♭6 = apply to interval shown
Slash (/) = raise by half step
```

### Roman Numeral Analysis

```
NOTATION CONVENTIONS:

UPPERCASE = Major
lowercase = minor
° = diminished
+ = augmented

FIGURES:
7, 65, 43, 42 for inversions

SECONDARY:
V/V, V7/vi, viio/ii

SPECIAL:
N6 or ♭II6 = Neapolitan
It+6, Fr+6, Gr+6 = Aug 6th
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts by Topic

### Pitch Organization

```
1. SCALES PROVIDE FRAMEWORK
   - Major and minor systems
   - Modes for color
   - Chromatic for embellishment

2. KEYS ORGANIZE HIERARCHY
   - Tonic is home
   - Dominant creates tension
   - Subdominant moves away

3. INTERVALS BUILD EVERYTHING
   - Melodic intervals = horizontal
   - Harmonic intervals = vertical
   - Quality determines color
```

### Harmonic Language

```
1. TRIADS ARE FOUNDATION
   - Four qualities
   - Three inversions
   - Diatonic functions

2. SEVENTH CHORDS ADD COLOR
   - V7 most important
   - Five main types
   - Resolve tendency tones

3. PROGRESSIONS FOLLOW LOGIC
   - T → S → D → T
   - Root motion by 5th strongest
   - Cadences punctuate phrases
```

### Melodic Elements

```
1. CONTOUR CREATES SHAPE
   - Balance steps and leaps
   - Compensate after leaps
   - Build to climax

2. NCTs EMBELLISH
   - Don't define harmony
   - Add motion and color
   - Resolve predictably

3. PHRASES STRUCTURE MUSIC
   - Period = question + answer
   - Cadences mark endings
   - Sentences develop ideas
```

### Chromatic Harmony

```
1. SECONDARY DOMINANTS TONICIZE
   - V/X creates temporary tonic
   - Raised notes = leading tones
   - Resolve like V → I

2. MODULATION CHANGES KEY
   - Pivot chord smoothest
   - Confirm with cadence
   - Closely related easiest

3. SPECIAL CHORDS ADD DRAMA
   - Neapolitan = ♭II6
   - Augmented 6ths expand to V
   - Borrowed chords mix modes
```

### Form

```
1. REPETITION CREATES UNITY
   - A sections return
   - Motives recur
   - Keys relate

2. CONTRAST CREATES INTEREST
   - B sections differ
   - Episodes in rondo
   - Development in sonata

3. RESOLUTION SATISFIES
   - Return to tonic
   - Recap in sonata
   - Final cadence
```
