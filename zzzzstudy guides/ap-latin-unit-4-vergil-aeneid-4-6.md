## 📝 Grammar Focus: Book 4 & 6 Constructions

### Jussive Subjunctive

```
Pattern:
Subjunctive as command (usually 3rd person)

Examples:
"eat!" = let him go!
"vīvat!" = may she live!
"audiat" = let him hear!

Negative: nē + subjunctive
"nē eat" = let him not go
```

### Optative Subjunctive (Wishes)

```
Pattern:
utinam + subjunctive

Achievable (present subj.):
"utinam veniat!" = may he come!

Unachievable (impf/plupf subj.):
"utinam venīret!" = would that he were coming!
"utinam vēnisset!" = would that he had come!

Vergilian Uses:
Dido's curses often optative
```

### Potential Subjunctive

```
Pattern:
Subjunctive alone = "would/could/might"

Example:
"quīs dubitet?" = who would doubt?
"dīxerit aliquis" = someone might say

Common in:
・Rhetorical questions
・Polite assertions
・Hypotheticals
```

## 🎯 AP Exam Practice

### Sight Reading - Book 4

```
Latin:
"Nec minus Aenēās, cāsū concussus inīquō,
multa gemēns magnōque animum labefactus amōre,
iussa tamen dīvum exsequitur classemque revīsit."

Parse:
・"concussus" = perf. pass. participle
・"gemēns" = present active participle
・"labefactus" = perf. pass. participle
・Main verb: "exsequitur...revīsit"

Translation:
"Nor less Aeneas, shaken by unjust fate,
groaning much and weakened in spirit by great love,
nevertheless carries out the commands of the gods
and revisits his fleet."
```

### Essay Prompt

```
Prompt: Analyze how Vergil creates sympathy for Dido
while still supporting Aeneas's departure.

Points to Address:
1. Dido as victim of gods (Cupid)
2. Her genuine love portrayed
3. Her noble past (fled Tyre)
4. Yet "furor" language marks excess
5. Aeneas's pain shown too
6. "Italiam non sponte sequor"
7. Cost of Roman destiny

Structure:
・Introduction: Vergil's ambivalence
・Dido's sympathetic portrayal
・Aeneas's conflict
・Divine machinery
・Conclusion: Both suffer for Rome
```
