**Good luck on your AP English Language exam! 🍀📝✨**

Remember: Line of reasoning is the logical progression that builds your argument. Every claim needs evidence + commentary (evidence shows what happened; commentary explains why it matters). Thesis statements should be arguable, specific, and defensible. Organize essays with clear topic sentences, smooth transitions, and unified paragraphs. Always include counterarguments to strengthen credibility!

## 📊 The Toulmin Model of Argument

### Core Components

| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Claim** | Main assertion | "Schools should start later" |
| **Data/Evidence** | Support for claim | "Studies show teens need 9 hours sleep" |
| **Warrant** | Logical connection | "More sleep improves performance" |
| **Backing** | Support for warrant | "Research on adolescent brain development" |
| **Qualifier** | Limits to claim | "In most cases..." |
| **Rebuttal** | Anticipated objection | "Unless extracurricular scheduling prevents it" |

### Toulmin Model Diagram

```
DATA ────────────────────────> CLAIM
           ↑                      ↑
           │                      │
        WARRANT              QUALIFIER
           ↑                      ↑
           │                      │
        BACKING              REBUTTAL
```

### Applying the Toulmin Model

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1** | State your claim | "Social media harms teen mental health" |
| **2** | Provide data | "Rates of depression increased 70% since 2010" |
| **3** | Explain warrant | "Correlation between screen time and anxiety" |
| **4** | Add backing | "Psychology research confirms mechanisms" |
| **5** | Include qualifier | "For heavy users..." |
| **6** | Address rebuttal | "Critics note correlation isn't causation" |

## 🧠 Logical Fallacies to Avoid

### Fallacies of Relevance

| Fallacy | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Ad hominem** | Attacking the person | "Don't listen to him—he's ugly" |
| **Appeal to authority** | Unqualified expert | "This actor endorses this medicine" |
| **Appeal to emotion** | Only using feelings | "Think of the children!" |
| **Bandwagon** | Everyone does it | "Everyone has one, so I need one" |
| **Red herring** | Distracting topic | Changing subject when losing |

### Fallacies of Insufficient Evidence

| Fallacy | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Hasty generalization** | Too few examples | "I met two rude New Yorkers, so all are rude" |
| **False cause** | Correlation ≠ causation | "Crime rose after video games became popular" |
| **Slippery slope** | Assuming chain reaction | "If we ban plastic bags, all freedom ends" |
| **Straw man** | Misrepresenting opponent | "My opponent wants open borders" (when they don't) |
| **False dilemma** | Only two options | "You're either with us or against us" |

### Fallacies of Clarity

| Fallacy | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Equivocation** | Shifting word meaning | "The law says men are equal, so women aren't" |
| **Circular reasoning** | Conclusion = premise | "The Bible is true because it says so" |
| **Loaded question** | Assumes conclusion | "When did you stop cheating?" |

## 🎯 Practice Prompts

### Argument Essay Practice

**Prompt 1:** Some argue that standardized testing accurately measures student achievement and should remain central to education. Others contend it narrows curriculum and stresses students. Write an essay arguing your position.

**Prompt 2:** Many colleges have made standardized tests optional for admission. Write an essay arguing whether this policy should continue.

**Prompt 3:** Some argue that social media companies should be legally responsible for content on their platforms. Write an essay arguing your position.

### Analyzing Line of Reasoning

Read the following passages and identify:
1. The main claim (thesis)
2. Supporting claims (topic sentences)
3. Types of evidence used
4. Quality of commentary
5. Logical progression (or gaps)
