## Unit 1: The Living World: Ecosystems (6-8%)

### Executive Summary
Unit 1 introduces fundamental ecological concepts including energy flow, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem structure. Understanding these foundational concepts is critical for analyzing environmental issues throughout the course.

### Key Concepts

#### 1.1 Introduction to Ecosystems
- **Ecosystem**: A community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment
- **Biotic factors**: Living components (plants, animals, microorganisms)
- **Abiotic factors**: Non-living components (temperature, water, sunlight, soil)
- **Biosphere**: The zone of Earth where life exists

#### 1.2 Terrestrial Biomes
| Biome | Climate | Key Characteristics | Example Locations |
|-------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Tropical Rainforest | Hot, wet year-round | Highest biodiversity, layered canopy | Amazon, Congo |
| Temperate Forest | Moderate temps, seasonal | Deciduous trees, distinct seasons | Eastern US, Europe |
| Boreal Forest (Taiga) | Cold, long winters | Coniferous trees, permafrost edges | Canada, Russia |
| Tundra | Very cold, permafrost | Low vegetation, fragile ecosystem | Arctic regions |
| Grassland | Moderate rainfall | Grasses dominate, fertile soil | Great Plains, Savanna |
| Desert | Low precipitation (<25 cm/yr) | Adapted plants/animals, extreme temps | Sahara, Mojave |
| Chaparral | Mediterranean climate | Shrubs, fire-adapted | California, Mediterranean |

#### 1.3 Aquatic Biomes
- **Freshwater**: Lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands
- **Marine**: Oceans, coral reefs, estuaries
- **Wetlands**: Transition zones, high productivity, water filtration
- **Estuaries**: Where freshwater meets saltwater, nursery habitats

#### 1.4 Trophic Levels and Energy Flow

**The 10% Rule**: Only ~10% of energy transfers between trophic levels

| Trophic Level | Examples | Energy Available |
|---------------|----------|------------------|
| Producers (1st) | Plants, algae, phytoplankton | 100% (10,000 kcal) |
| Primary Consumers (2nd) | Herbivores | 10% (1,000 kcal) |
| Secondary Consumers (3rd) | Small carnivores | 1% (100 kcal) |
| Tertiary Consumers (4th) | Top predators | 0.1% (10 kcal) |

**Key Formulas**:
- **Ecological Efficiency** = (Energy at higher level / Energy at lower level) × 100%
- **Net Primary Productivity (NPP)** = GPP - Respiration
- **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)** = Total energy captured by producers

#### 1.5 Biogeochemical Cycles

**Carbon Cycle**:
- Photosynthesis: CO₂ → organic carbon
- Cellular respiration: organic carbon → CO₂
- Combustion: fossil fuels → CO₂
- Ocean absorption: atmosphere ↔ dissolved CO₂
- Carbon sinks: forests, oceans, soil

**Nitrogen Cycle**:
1. **Nitrogen fixation**: N₂ → NH₃ (bacteria, lightning)
2. **Nitrification**: NH₃ → NO₂⁻ → NO₃⁻
3. **Assimilation**: Plants absorb NO₃⁻
4. **Ammonification**: Decomposition → NH₄⁺
5. **Denitrification**: NO₃⁻ → N₂ (returns to atmosphere)

**Phosphorus Cycle**:
- No atmospheric component (unlike C and N)
- Weathering releases phosphate from rocks
- Limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems
- Human impact: fertilizers, detergents

**Hydrologic (Water) Cycle**:
- Evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation
- Runoff, infiltration, groundwater flow
- Residence times vary by reservoir

#### 1.6 Primary Productivity
- **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)**: Total energy captured
- **Net Primary Productivity (NPP)**: Energy available for consumers
- Highest NPP: tropical rainforests, estuaries, coral reefs
- Lowest NPP: deserts, open ocean, tundra

### Common Misconceptions - Unit 1
1. ❌ Energy is recycled through ecosystems (❌ Energy flows, matter cycles)
2. ❌ Decomposers are at the top of the food chain (❌ They process all levels)
3. ❌ The nitrogen cycle doesn't involve bacteria (❌ Bacteria are essential)
4. ❌ All ecosystems have the same productivity (❌ Varies greatly)

## Unit 2: The Living World: Biodiversity (6-8%)

### Executive Summary
Unit 2 explores biodiversity at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. Understanding species interactions, natural selection, and ecosystem services is essential for evaluating conservation strategies.

### Key Concepts

#### 2.1 Introduction to Biodiversity
**Three Levels of Biodiversity**:
1. **Genetic diversity**: Variation within a species
2. **Species diversity**: Number of different species
3. **Ecosystem diversity**: Variety of ecosystems in an area

#### 2.2 Ecosystem Services
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Provisioning | Food, water, timber, fiber, fuel |
| Regulating | Climate regulation, flood control, water purification |
| Cultural | Recreation, aesthetic, spiritual |
| Supporting | Nutrient cycling, soil formation, photosynthesis |

#### 2.3 Island Biogeography
**Theory of Island Biogeography** (MacArthur & Wilson):
- Larger islands = more species
- Closer islands = more species (easier colonization)
- Equilibrium between immigration and extinction
- Applications to habitat fragmentation

#### 2.4 Species Interactions
| Interaction | Species A | Species B | Example |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Mutualism | + | + | Bee and flower |
| Commensalism | + | 0 | Barnacle on whale |
| Parasitism | + | - | Tick on deer |
| Predation | + | - | Lion and zebra |
| Competition | - | - | Two species for same resource |

#### 2.5 Keystone Species and Ecological Roles
- **Keystone species**: Disproportionately large impact relative to abundance
  - Example: Sea otters (control sea urchins, protect kelp forests)
- **Foundation species**: Create habitat for others (coral, kelp)
- **Indicator species**: Reflect environmental conditions (amphibians)

#### 2.6 Ecological Succession
**Primary Succession**: Begins with no soil (bare rock, lava)
1. Pioneer species (lichens, mosses)
2. Soil development
3. Herbaceous plants
4. Shrubs and small trees
5. Climax community

**Secondary Succession**: Begins with existing soil (after disturbance)
- Faster than primary succession
- Examples: After fire, flood, or farming

#### 2.7 Natural Selection and Evolution
- **Natural selection**: Differential survival and reproduction
- **Adaptation**: Traits that increase survival/reproduction
- **Speciation**: Formation of new species
- **Coevolution**: Two species evolving in response to each other

#### 2.8 Ecological Tolerance

- **Optimal range**: Conditions for maximum growth
- **Limiting factors**: Resources in shortest supply

### Common Misconceptions - Unit 2
1. ❌ All species are equally important (❌ Keystone species have outsized effects)
2. ❌ Evolution occurs within an individual's lifetime (❌ Occurs over generations)
3. ❌ Competition always leads to extinction (❌ Can lead to niche partitioning)

- **Type III**: High mortality early, survivors live long (fish, oysters)

#### 3.4 Carrying Capacity (K)
- Maximum population an environment can sustain
- Determined by limiting factors (food, water, space)
- Population oscillates around K

#### 3.5 Population Growth Equations

**Exponential Growth** (J-curve):
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$$

Where:
- N = population size
- r = intrinsic rate of increase
- t = time

**Logistic Growth** (S-curve):
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(\frac{K-N}{K}\right)$$

Where K = carrying capacity

**Population Growth Rate Calculations**:
$$r = \frac{(births - deaths)}{population} \times 1000$$

**Doubling Time (Rule of 70)**:
$$\text{Doubling Time} = \frac{70}{\text{growth rate (\%)}}$$

**Example**: If growth rate = 2%, doubling time = 70/2 = 35 years

#### 3.9 Human Population Growth
- Current population: ~8 billion
- Growth rate: ~1.0% (slowing)
- Most growth in developing countries
- Impacts: resource depletion, pollution, habitat loss

### Key Population Calculations

**Percent Change**:
$$\% \text{ change} = \frac{\text{new} - \text{old}}{\text{old}} \times 100$$

**Population Density**:
$$\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}}$$

**National Population Change**:
$$\text{Change} = (\text{Births} - \text{Deaths}) + (\text{Immigration} - \text{Emigration})$$

### Common Misconceptions - Unit 3
1. ❌ Populations always grow exponentially (❌ Limited by carrying capacity)
2. ❌ All species have the same reproductive strategies (❌ r vs K selected)
3. ❌ Demographic transition happens automatically (❌ Requires specific conditions)
