## 📚 Sample Rhetorical Analysis Paragraphs

### Model Body Paragraph 1: Analyzing Ethos

**Topic Sentence:** King establishes credibility by positioning himself within a tradition of moral authority that his audience cannot easily dismiss.

**Evidence:** Early in the letter, King compares himself to the Apostle Paul, writing that "just as Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ," he too must respond to calls for aid beyond his hometown.

**Analysis:** This biblical allusion serves multiple functions. For his audience of Christian clergymen, the comparison places King's activism within a framework they must respect—Christian missionary work. Moreover, by invoking Paul, King transforms his "outsider" status from a liability into a spiritual calling, suggesting that his critics' objection to outside interference fails to understand the universal nature of moral duty.

### Model Body Paragraph 2: Analyzing Pathos

**Topic Sentence:** Through a masterful use of accumulated detail, King makes abstract injustice viscerally present to readers who have never experienced it.

**Evidence:** King writes, "when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, and even kill your black brothers and sisters..."

**Analysis:** The anaphora of "when you have seen" forces readers to adopt the witnessing position, making them imaginative participants in these horrors. The progression from family members—"mothers and fathers," "sisters and brothers"—invokes the universal bonds that cross racial lines, compelling white readers to recognize the humanity of those suffering. The verbs escalate from "curse" to "kick" to "kill," building to an emotional crescendo that makes continued patience seem not virtuous but complicit.

### Model Body Paragraph 3: Analyzing Logos

**Topic Sentence:** King systematically dismantles his critics' arguments through a logical structure that anticipates and addresses each objection.

**Evidence:** The letter proceeds through a series of questions King attributes to his critics: "Why direct action? Why sit-ins? Why not negotiation?" Each question is posed and then methodically answered.

**Analysis:** This question-and-answer structure (known as hypophora) accomplishes several rhetorical goals simultaneously. It demonstrates King's thorough understanding of opposing viewpoints, strengthening his ethos as a fair-minded interlocutor. It allows him to control the terms of debate by selecting which objections to address. Most importantly, it creates a sense of logical inevitability—once each objection is refuted, readers are left with no rational basis for opposition.
