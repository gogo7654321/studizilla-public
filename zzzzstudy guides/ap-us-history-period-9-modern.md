## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE factor that contributed to the rise of the conservative movement in the 1980s.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The religious right emerged as a powerful political force, mobilizing evangelical Christians who were concerned about social changes such as legalized abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973), removal of school prayer, and what they perceived as moral decline. Organizations like Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority (1979) registered voters and advocated for candidates who supported traditional family values, providing Reagan with crucial support in 1980."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE way that globalization changed the American economy AND ONE political response to these changes.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Change: Globalization led to significant deindustrialization as American manufacturing companies moved production to countries with lower labor costs, particularly after NAFTA (1994) and China's entry into the WTO (2001). Industrial centers in the Midwest became the 'Rust Belt' as factories closed, devastating communities dependent on manufacturing jobs.

Response: Both liberal and conservative populist movements responded to these changes. From the left, figures like Bernie Sanders criticized trade deals and Wall Street; from the right, Donald Trump campaigned on economic nationalism, promising to renegotiate trade deals, impose tariffs, and bring manufacturing jobs back, winning key Rust Belt states in 2016."
