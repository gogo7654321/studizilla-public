## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: A client is diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Explain how each of the following could contribute to understanding or treating this disorder:

(a) Serotonin
(b) Beck's cognitive triad
(c) SSRIs
(d) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

**Answer**:

(a) **Serotonin**: Depression is associated with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, sleep, and appetite. The biological perspective suggests that insufficient serotonin activity in the brain contributes to depressive symptoms. This understanding has led to the development of medications that target the serotonin system.

(b) **Beck's cognitive triad**: Aaron Beck proposed that depression involves negative thinking patterns about three areas: the self ("I'm worthless"), the world ("Everything is hopeless"), and the future ("Nothing will ever improve"). These negative automatic thoughts maintain and worsen depression. Cognitive therapy aims to identify and challenge these distorted thinking patterns.

(c) **SSRIs**: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors are antidepressant medications that work by preventing the reabsorption of serotonin in the brain, making more serotonin available in the synapse. Common SSRIs include Prozac and Zoloft. They are often the first-line medication treatment for depression because they have fewer side effects than older antidepressants.

(d) **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**: CBT combines cognitive techniques (identifying and challenging negative thoughts) with behavioral techniques (increasing activities, behavioral activation). For depression, CBT might help the client recognize cognitive distortions, develop more realistic thinking patterns, and gradually increase engagement in pleasurable activities. Research shows CBT is highly effective for depression and can be as effective as medication.
