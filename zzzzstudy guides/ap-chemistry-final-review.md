## 🔬 Unit 1: Atomic Structure and Properties

### 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass

**Key Concept:** The mole connects microscopic particles to macroscopic measurements.

**Essential Equations:**
```
n = m/M          (moles = mass/molar mass)
n = N/Nₐ         (moles = particles/Avogadro's number)
M = Σ(atomic mass × atoms)   (molar mass calculation)
```

**Percent Composition:**
```
% by mass = (mass of element in 1 mol compound / molar mass of compound) × 100%
```

### 1.2 Mass Spectrometry

**How It Works:**
1. Vaporization → Ionization → Acceleration → Deflection → Detection

**Reading Mass Spectra:**
- x-axis: mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
- y-axis: relative abundance
- Highest peak = base peak (most stable fragment)
- Weighted average = average atomic mass

**Calculation:**
```
Average atomic mass = Σ(isotope mass × fractional abundance)
```

### 1.3 Electron Configuration

**Aufbau Principle:** Fill orbitals from lowest to highest energy
**Pauli Exclusion:** Maximum 2 electrons per orbital (opposite spins)
**Hund's Rule:** Fill degenerate orbitals singly before pairing

**Order of Filling:**
```
1s → 2s → 2p → 3s → 3p → 4s → 3d → 4p → 5s → 4d → 5p → 6s → 4f → 5d → 6p → 7s → 5f → 6d → 7p
```

**Exceptions to Remember:**
- Chromium: [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹ (not 3d⁴ 4s²)
- Copper: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ (not 3d⁹ 4s²)
- Half-filled and fully-filled d orbitals are extra stable

### 1.4 Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)

**Interpretation:**
- x-axis: Binding energy (decreases left to right)
- y-axis: Relative number of electrons
- Peak height = number of electrons in subshell
- Peak position = energy required to remove electron

**Key Relationships:**
```
Higher binding energy → Closer to nucleus → Core electrons
Lower binding energy → Valence electrons
```

### 1.5 Periodic Trends

| Property | Across Period (→) | Down Group (↓) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Atomic Radius | Decreases | Increases |
| Ionization Energy | Increases | Decreases |
| Electronegativity | Increases | Decreases |
| Electron Affinity | Becomes more negative | Becomes less negative |
| Metallic Character | Decreases | Increases |

**Trend Explanations:**
- **Atomic radius:** More protons = stronger pull on electrons (across); more shells (down)
- **Ionization energy:** Smaller atoms hold electrons tighter
- **Electronegativity:** Stronger nuclear attraction for bonding electrons

**Exceptions:**
- IE drops slightly from Group 2A → 3A (losing from higher-energy p orbital)
- IE drops from Group 5A → 6A (paired electrons easier to remove)

## 🔗 Unit 2: Molecular and Ionic Compound Structure

### 2.1 Types of Chemical Bonds

| Bond Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Ionic | Metal + Nonmetal; electron transfer | NaCl |
| Covalent | Nonmetal + Nonmetal; electron sharing | H₂O |
| Metallic | Metal + Metal; sea of electrons | Fe |

### 2.2 Lewis Structures

**Steps to Draw:**
1. Count total valence electrons (add for anions, subtract for cations)
2. Draw single bonds between atoms
3. Complete octets on outer atoms
4. Place remaining electrons on central atom
5. Form multiple bonds if central atom lacks octet

**Formal Charge:**
```
FC = Valence e⁻ - Lone pair e⁻ - ½(Bonding e⁻)
```

**Best Lewis Structure:** Minimizes formal charges; negative FC on more electronegative atom

### 2.3 Resonance Structures

- Occur when multiple valid Lewis structures exist
- Electrons are delocalized (spread out)
- Actual structure is a hybrid of all resonance forms
- All structures have same atom arrangement, only electrons move

### 2.4 VSEPR Theory

| 6 | Octahedral | 5 | 1 | Square pyramidal | <90° | BrF₅ |
| 6 | Octahedral | 4 | 2 | Square planar | 90° | XeF₄ |

### 2.5 Hybridization

| 2 | sp | Linear | BeCl₂ |
| 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | BF₃ |
| 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | CH₄ |
| 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | PCl₅ |
| 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | SF₆ |

### 2.6 Bond Polarity and Molecular Polarity

**Bond Polarity:**
- Electronegativity difference > 0.4 = polar covalent
- Electronegativity difference > 1.7 = ionic

**Molecular Polarity:**
- Must have polar bonds AND asymmetric geometry
- Symmetric molecules (linear with 2 same atoms, trigonal planar, tetrahedral with 4 same atoms) are nonpolar

## ⚡ Unit 3: Intermolecular Forces and Properties

### 3.1 Types of Intermolecular Forces (IMFs)

| IMF | Strength | Description | Example |
|-----|----------|-------------|---------|
| London Dispersion (LDF) | Weakest | Temporary dipoles in all molecules | Noble gases, CH₄ |
| Dipole-Dipole | Medium | Permanent dipoles attract | HCl |
| Hydrogen Bonding | Strong | H bonded to F, O, or N | H₂O, NH₃, HF |
| Ion-Dipole | Strongest | Ion interacts with polar molecule | Na⁺ in H₂O |

**Factors Affecting LDF Strength:**
- More electrons = stronger LDF
- More surface area = stronger LDF
- Branching decreases surface area and LDF

### 3.2 Properties Affected by IMFs

| Property | Stronger IMFs → |
|----------|-----------------|
| Boiling Point | Higher |
| Melting Point | Higher |
| Vapor Pressure | Lower |
| Surface Tension | Higher |
| Viscosity | Higher |
| Solubility in Water | Higher (if polar) |

### 3.3 Phase Diagrams

**Key Points:**
- **Triple Point:** All three phases coexist
- **Critical Point:** Beyond this, liquid and gas are indistinguishable (supercritical fluid)
- **Normal boiling point:** Temperature where vapor pressure = 1 atm

**Phase Changes:**
```
Solid → Liquid: Melting (ΔH > 0)
Liquid → Gas: Vaporization (ΔH > 0)
Solid → Gas: Sublimation (ΔH > 0)
Gas → Liquid: Condensation (ΔH < 0)
Liquid → Solid: Freezing (ΔH < 0)
Gas → Solid: Deposition (ΔH < 0)
```

### 3.4 Solutions and Solubility

**"Like Dissolves Like"**
- Polar solvents dissolve polar/ionic solutes
- Nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes

**Concentration Units:**
```
Molarity (M) = mol solute / L solution
Molality (m) = mol solute / kg solvent
Mole fraction (χ) = mol component / total mol
Mass percent = (mass solute / mass solution) × 100%
```

### 3.5 Colligative Properties

**Depend on number of particles, not identity**

```
Vapor pressure lowering: ΔP = χ_solute × P°_solvent
Boiling point elevation: ΔTb = i × Kb × m
Freezing point depression: ΔTf = i × Kf × m
Osmotic pressure: π = iMRT
```

Where **i = van't Hoff factor** (number of particles per formula unit)
- NaCl: i = 2
- CaCl₂: i = 3
- Glucose: i = 1

### 3.6 Separation Techniques

| Technique | Separates Based On | Used For |

```

**Memory Aid:** OIL RIG (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain)

### 4.4 Stoichiometry

**Mole Ratios from Balanced Equations:**
```
Given → Moles of given → Moles of wanted → Wanted
        ÷ molar mass    × mole ratio      × molar mass
```

**Limiting Reactant:**
- Calculate product from each reactant
- Reactant that produces less product is limiting
- Other reactant(s) are in excess

**Percent Yield:**
```
% Yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
```

---

## ⏱️ Unit 5: Kinetics

### 5.1 Reaction Rate

**Definition:** Change in concentration per unit time

```
Rate = -Δ[Reactant]/Δt = +Δ[Product]/Δt
```

**For reaction: aA + bB → cC + dD**
```
Rate = -(1/a)(Δ[A]/Δt) = -(1/b)(Δ[B]/Δt) = (1/c)(Δ[C]/Δt) = (1/d)(Δ[D]/Δt)
```

### 5.2 Rate Laws

**Rate Law:** Rate = k[A]ᵐ[B]ⁿ

| Order | Rate Law | Integrated Rate Law | Half-Life | Straight-Line Plot |
|-------|----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 0 | Rate = k | [A] = -kt + [A]₀ | t½ = [A]₀/2k | [A] vs t |
| 1 | Rate = k[A] | ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]₀ | t½ = 0.693/k | ln[A] vs t |
| 2 | Rate = k[A]² | 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]₀ | t½ = 1/(k[A]₀) | 1/[A] vs t |

**Determining Order from Data:**
- If doubling [A] doubles rate → first order in A
- If doubling [A] quadruples rate → second order in A
- If doubling [A] has no effect → zero order in A

### 5.3 Reaction Mechanisms

**Elementary Steps:** Individual molecular events
**Molecularity:** Number of reactant molecules in elementary step
- Unimolecular: A → products (first order)
- Bimolecular: A + B → products (second order overall)

**Rate-Determining Step (RDS):**
- Slowest step in mechanism
- Determines overall rate law
- Rate law of RDS = rate law of overall reaction (using intermediates if needed)

**Valid Mechanism Requirements:**
1. Elementary steps sum to overall reaction
2. Rate law from RDS matches experimental rate law
3. Each step is plausible (usually uni- or bimolecular)

### 5.4 Collision Theory and Arrhenius Equation

**For Successful Reaction:**
1. Molecules must collide
2. With sufficient energy (≥ Eₐ)
3. With proper orientation

**Arrhenius Equation:**
```
k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

ln k = -Ea/R × (1/T) + ln A

ln(k₂/k₁) = (Ea/R)(1/T₁ - 1/T₂)
```

**Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:**
| Factor | Effect on Rate |
|--------|----------------|
| Increase temperature | Increases |
| Increase concentration | Increases (usually) |
| Add catalyst | Increases |
| Increase surface area | Increases |

### 5.5 Catalysis

**Catalyst:** Increases rate without being consumed; lowers activation energy

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Homogeneous | Same phase as reactants | Acid catalysis in solution |
| Heterogeneous | Different phase from reactants | Metal surface catalyst |
| Enzyme | Biological catalyst | Catalase |

**Energy Diagram Effects:**
- Catalyst creates alternative pathway with lower Eₐ
- Does NOT change ΔH or ΔG of reaction
- Does NOT change equilibrium position

## ⚖️ Unit 6: Thermodynamics

### 6.1 Energy and Enthalpy

**System vs Surroundings:**
- System: What we're studying
- Surroundings: Everything else

**First Law of Thermodynamics:**
```
ΔE = q + w
ΔE = change in internal energy
q = heat (+ into system, - out of system)
w = work (+ on system, - by system)
```

**Work at Constant Pressure:**
```
w = -PΔV
```

**Enthalpy:**
```
ΔH = qₚ (heat at constant pressure)
ΔH < 0: Exothermic (releases heat)
ΔH > 0: Endothermic (absorbs heat)
```

### 6.2 Enthalpy Calculations

**Calorimetry:**
```
q = mcΔT (specific heat capacity)
q = CΔT (heat capacity)
q_system = -q_surroundings
```

**Standard Enthalpies:**
```
ΔH°rxn = Σn·ΔH°f(products) - Σn·ΔH°f(reactants)
```

**Hess's Law:** If a reaction can be expressed as sum of other reactions, ΔH is sum of their ΔH values.

**Bond Enthalpies:**
```
ΔH°rxn = Σ(bonds broken) - Σ(bonds formed)
```
Note: Breaking bonds requires energy (+), forming bonds releases energy (-)

### 6.3 Entropy

**Second Law of Thermodynamics:** Total entropy of universe always increases in spontaneous processes.

**Entropy (S):** Measure of disorder/randomness

**Factors Increasing Entropy:**
- Solid → Liquid → Gas
- Fewer moles → More moles (of gas)
- Lower temperature → Higher temperature
- Pure substance → Mixture
- Simpler → More complex molecules

**Standard Entropy Change:**
```
ΔS°rxn = Σn·S°(products) - Σn·S°(reactants)
```

### 6.4 Gibbs Free Energy

**Definition:**
```
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
```

**Spontaneity:**
| ΔG | Process |
|----|---------|
| < 0 | Spontaneous (favored) |
| = 0 | At equilibrium |
| > 0 | Non-spontaneous (not favored) |

**Temperature Dependence:**

| ΔH | ΔS | Spontaneity |
|----|----|----|
| - | + | Always spontaneous |
| + | - | Never spontaneous |
| - | - | Spontaneous at low T |
| + | + | Spontaneous at high T |

**Standard Free Energy:**
```
ΔG°rxn = Σn·ΔG°f(products) - Σn·ΔG°f(reactants)
ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn
```

### 6.5 Free Energy and Equilibrium

**Relationship:**
```
ΔG° = -RT ln K

ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
```

**At Equilibrium (ΔG = 0):**
```
ΔG° = -RT ln K
K = e^(-ΔG°/RT)
```

| ΔG° | K | Equilibrium Position |
|-----|---|---------------------|
| < 0 | > 1 | Favors products |
| = 0 | = 1 | Equal amounts |
| > 0 | < 1 | Favors reactants |

---

## ⚖️ Unit 7: Equilibrium

### 7.1 Equilibrium Concepts

**Dynamic Equilibrium:** Forward and reverse rates are equal; concentrations constant but not equal.

**Equilibrium Constant Expression:**
For aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD:
```
Kc = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b   (using concentrations)
Kp = (P_C)^c(P_D)^d / (P_A)^a(P_B)^b   (using partial pressures)
```

**Rules:**
- Pure solids and liquids are NOT included (activity = 1)
- Aqueous solutions and gases ARE included
- Coefficients become exponents

**Relationship Between Kc and Kp:**
```
Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn
Δn = moles gaseous products - moles gaseous reactants
```

### 7.2 Reaction Quotient (Q)

**Q uses current concentrations; K uses equilibrium concentrations**

| Compare Q to K | Direction of Shift |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Q < K | Forward (toward products) |
| Q = K | At equilibrium |
| Q > K | Reverse (toward reactants) |

### 7.3 ICE Tables

**I**nitial, **C**hange, **E**quilibrium

**Steps:**
1. Write equilibrium expression
2. Set up ICE table with initial concentrations
3. Express changes in terms of x (using stoichiometry)
4. Write equilibrium concentrations
5. Substitute into K expression and solve

**Approximation:** If K << 1 and [initial] >> K, assume x is negligible
- Check: x should be < 5% of initial concentration

### 7.4 Le Chatelier's Principle

**System at equilibrium responds to stress to counteract it.**

| Stress | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Add reactant | Shift right (toward products) |
| Add product | Shift left (toward reactants) |
| Remove reactant | Shift left |
| Remove product | Shift right |
| Increase pressure | Shift toward fewer moles of gas |
| Decrease pressure | Shift toward more moles of gas |
| Increase temperature | Shift in endothermic direction |
| Decrease temperature | Shift in exothermic direction |
| Add catalyst | NO shift (reaches equilibrium faster) |
| Add inert gas (constant V) | NO shift |

### 7.5 Solubility Equilibria

**Solubility Product (Ksp):**
For MₐXᵦ ⇌ aM^(b+) + bX^(a-)
```
Ksp = [M^(b+)]^a[X^(a-)]^b
```

**Molar Solubility (s):** Moles that dissolve per liter

**Common Ion Effect:** Solubility decreases when a common ion is present

**Precipitation Prediction:**
- Q < Ksp: Unsaturated, no precipitate
- Q = Ksp: Saturated, at equilibrium
- Q > Ksp: Supersaturated, precipitate forms

## 🧪 Unit 8: Acids and Bases

### 8.1 Definitions

| Theory | Acid | Base |
|--------|------|------|
| Arrhenius | Produces H⁺ in water | Produces OH⁻ in water |
| Brønsted-Lowry | Proton (H⁺) donor | Proton (H⁺) acceptor |
| Lewis | Electron pair acceptor | Electron pair donor |

### 8.2 Strong vs Weak Acids and Bases

**Strong Acids (memorize):** HCl, HBr, HI, HNO₃, H₂SO₄, HClO₄, HClO₃

**Strong Bases (memorize):** Group 1 hydroxides (LiOH, NaOH, KOH), Ba(OH)₂, Sr(OH)₂, Ca(OH)₂

**Weak Acids:** Partially dissociate; have Ka < 1
**Weak Bases:** Partially dissociate; have Kb < 1

### 8.3 pH Calculations

**Definitions:**
```
pH = -log[H⁺]
pOH = -log[OH⁻]
pKa = -log Ka
pKb = -log Kb

pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)
Ka × Kb = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)
pKa + pKb = 14
```

**Strong Acid/Base:**
```
[H⁺] = initial acid concentration
[OH⁻] = (coefficient) × initial base concentration
```

**Weak Acid (HA):**
```
Ka = [H⁺][A⁻]/[HA]
For weak acid: [H⁺] ≈ √(Ka × [HA]₀) if Ka << [HA]₀
```

**Weak Base (B):**
```
Kb = [BH⁺][OH⁻]/[B]
For weak base: [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb × [B]₀) if Kb << [B]₀
```

### 8.4 Polyprotic Acids

- Lose H⁺ one at a time
- Ka₁ > Ka₂ > Ka₃ (each successive dissociation is weaker)
- Usually only first dissociation significantly affects pH

**Examples:** H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄, H₂CO₃

### 8.5 Buffers

**Definition:** Solution that resists pH change; contains weak acid + conjugate base (or weak base + conjugate acid)

**Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**
```
pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])
pOH = pKb + log([BH⁺]/[B])
```

**Buffer Capacity:** Ability to resist pH change; greatest when [HA] = [A⁻]

**Effective Buffer Range:** pKa ± 1

**How Buffers Work:**
- Added H⁺ reacts with A⁻: H⁺ + A⁻ → HA
- Added OH⁻ reacts with HA: OH⁻ + HA → A⁻ + H₂O

### 8.6 Titrations

**Equivalence Point:** Moles acid = moles base

**Strong Acid + Strong Base:**
- Equivalence point pH = 7
- Use phenolphthalein or bromothymol blue

**Weak Acid + Strong Base:**
- Equivalence point pH > 7
- At half-equivalence: pH = pKa
- Use phenolphthalein

**Strong Acid + Weak Base:**
- Equivalence point pH < 7
- Use methyl orange or methyl red

**Weak Acid + Weak Base:**
- pH at equivalence depends on relative Ka and Kb
- Difficult to find suitable indicator

### 8.7 Acid-Base Properties of Salts

| Salt From | pH of Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Strong acid + Strong base | 7 (neutral) |
| Strong acid + Weak base | < 7 (acidic) |
| Weak acid + Strong base | > 7 (basic) |
| Weak acid + Weak base | Compare Ka and Kb |

## ⚡ Unit 9: Applications of Thermodynamics (Electrochemistry)

### 9.1 Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells

**Spontaneous redox reaction produces electrical energy**

**Components:**
- **Anode:** Oxidation occurs; negative electrode; electrons leave
- **Cathode:** Reduction occurs; positive electrode; electrons enter
- **Salt bridge:** Maintains electrical neutrality; ions flow
- **External wire:** Electrons flow from anode to cathode

**Memory Aid:** AN OX (anode oxidation), RED CAT (reduction cathode)

### 9.2 Cell Notation

```
Anode | Anode solution || Cathode solution | Cathode
```

Example: Zn | Zn²⁺(aq) || Cu²⁺(aq) | Cu

### 9.3 Standard Reduction Potentials

**Cell Potential:**
```
E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode
E°cell = E°reduction - E°oxidation
```

**Positive E°cell:** Spontaneous reaction (galvanic cell)
**Negative E°cell:** Non-spontaneous (requires electrolysis)

**Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE):** Reference; E° = 0.00 V

### 9.4 Relationships Between E°, ΔG°, and K

```
ΔG° = -nFE°
ΔG° = -RT ln K
E° = (RT/nF) ln K = (0.0592 V/n) log K  (at 25°C)
```

Where:
- n = moles of electrons transferred
- F = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)

| E°cell | ΔG° | K | Spontaneity |
|--------|-----|---|-------------|
| > 0 | < 0 | > 1 | Spontaneous |
| = 0 | = 0 | = 1 | Equilibrium |
| < 0 | > 0 | < 1 | Non-spontaneous |

### 9.5 Nernst Equation

**For non-standard conditions:**
```
E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q
E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q  (at 25°C)
```

**At equilibrium:** E = 0 and Q = K

### 9.6 Electrolysis

**Non-spontaneous reaction driven by external power source**

**Electrolytic Cell:**
- Anode: Still oxidation, but now positive electrode
- Cathode: Still reduction, but now negative electrode
- Requires external voltage greater than |E°cell|

**Faraday's Laws:**
```
Charge: q = It (coulombs = amps × seconds)
Moles of electrons: n = q/F
Mass deposited: m = (q × M)/(n × F)
```

Where:
- I = current (amperes)
- t = time (seconds)
- M = molar mass of element
- n = electrons per atom deposited

### 9.7 Batteries and Fuel Cells
