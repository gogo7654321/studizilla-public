## 📖 Extended Passage Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Sonnet Analysis

**Poem: Shakespeare's Sonnet 130**
> "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
> Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
> If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
> If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head."

| Element | Observation | Analysis |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Form** | English sonnet, iambic pentameter | Traditional form with subversive content |
| **Anti-Petrarchan** | Rejects conventional blazon | Critiques false praise in love poetry |
| **Irony** | Seems insulting, is loving | Authentic love vs. poetic convention |
| **Volta** | "And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare" | Shift reveals sincerity |

**Sample thesis:** Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 employs the blazon tradition only to subvert it, using ironic negations to argue that genuine love transcends the ornate falsifications of conventional love poetry.

### Example 2: Romantic Ode Analysis

**Poem: Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" (excerpt)**
> "Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
> Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
> Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
> A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme"

| Element | Observation | Analysis |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Apostrophe** | Addresses the urn directly | Elevates object to conversational partner |
| **Paradox** | "Unravish'd bride," "foster-child" | Urn's eternal, frozen state |
| **Personification** | Urn as historian, bride, child | Multiple identities explore art's nature |
| **Sound** | "Silence and slow time" | Sibilance creates hushed tone |

**Sample thesis:** Keats's ode explores the paradox of artistic permanence through personification of the urn as simultaneously bride, child, and historian, suggesting that art achieves immortality by sacrificing the dynamic reality it represents.

### Example 3: Modern Poetry Analysis

**Poem: Langston Hughes's "Harlem"**
> "What happens to a dream deferred?
> Does it dry up
> like a raisin in the sun?
> Or fester like a sore—
> And then run?"

| Element | Observation | Analysis |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Central question** | Opens with question | Engages reader, establishes theme |
| **Similes** | Raisin, sore, meat, sweet | Sensory, visceral comparisons |
| **Progression** | Increasingly violent images | Building tension toward explosion |
| **Form** | Short lines, free verse | Jazz-influenced rhythm |

**Sample thesis:** Hughes's "Harlem" uses a sequence of increasingly disturbing similes to transform abstract "deferred dreams" into visceral sensory experiences, culminating in the explosive image that suggests suppressed aspirations become revolutionary force.

## ✍️ Sample Thesis Statements for Poetry

### By Technique

| Technique | Sample Thesis |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Form** | "Dickinson's disruption of hymn meter through dashes and slant rhyme creates theological uncertainty, mirroring her ambivalent relationship with Calvinist faith." |
| **Imagery** | "Plath's Holocaust imagery in 'Daddy' collapses personal trauma into historical atrocity, suggesting that patriarchal oppression operates through the same mechanisms of dehumanization." |
| **Sound** | "Poe's hypnotic trochaic rhythm in 'The Raven' creates an incantatory effect that entraps both speaker and reader, formally enacting the inescapable nature of grief." |

### By Theme

| Theme | Sample Thesis |
|-------|---------------|
| **Mortality** | "Donne's 'Death Be Not Proud' challenges death's sovereignty through accumulating paradoxes that diminish death even as they acknowledge its power." |
| **Nature** | "Frost's 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening' creates tension between the seductive oblivion of nature and the demands of social obligation, ultimately leaving the speaker's choice ambiguous." |
| **Identity** | "Whitman's use of the catalog in 'Song of Myself' dissolves individual identity into democratic multitude, embodying the egalitarian vision of American selfhood." |

**Good luck on your AP English Literature exam! 🍀📖✨**

Remember: Form and content work together—ask why this form for this content. Sound matters—read aloud to hear rhythm and music. The speaker is not the poet. Analyze HOW poetic elements create meaning. Identify shifts—they often mark key moments. Theme should be a complete idea, not just a topic!
