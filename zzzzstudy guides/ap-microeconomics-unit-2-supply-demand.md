| **Inverse relationship** | Price and Qd move opposite |
| **Ceteris paribus** | All else equal |
| **Downward sloping** | Demand curve |

### Why Demand Slopes Down

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Substitution effect** | Higher price → buy substitutes |
| **Income effect** | Higher price → less purchasing power |
| **Diminishing marginal utility** | Less value from additional units |

### Demand vs. Quantity Demanded

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Demand** | Entire curve (all price-quantity combinations) |
| **Quantity demanded** | Specific point on curve |
| **Change in demand** | Shift of curve |
| **Change in Qd** | Movement along curve |

### Determinants of Demand (Shifters)

| Shifter | Effect on Demand |
|---------|------------------|
| **Income** | Normal goods: ↑ income → ↑ demand |
|  | Inferior goods: ↑ income → ↓ demand |
| **Tastes/preferences** | More popular → ↑ demand |
| **Price of related goods** | Substitutes: ↑ Psub → ↑ demand |
|  | Complements: ↑ Pcomp → ↓ demand |
| **Number of buyers** | More buyers → ↑ demand |
| **Expectations** | Expect ↑ price → ↑ demand now |

### Normal vs. Inferior Goods

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Normal good** | Demand ↑ when income ↑ | Restaurant meals |
| **Inferior good** | Demand ↓ when income ↑ | Ramen noodles |

## ⚖️ Market Equilibrium

### Equilibrium

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Equilibrium price** | Where Qd = Qs |
| **Equilibrium quantity** | Quantity at that price |
| **Market clearing** | No shortage or surplus |
| **Stable** | Market tends toward it |

### Finding Equilibrium

| Method | Process |
|--------|---------|
| **Graphically** | Where curves intersect |
| **Algebraically** | Set Qd = Qs and solve |
| **Table** | Find where Qd = Qs |

### Disequilibrium

| Situation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Shortage** | Qd > Qs (price too low) |
| **Surplus** | Qs > Qd (price too high) |

### Market Adjustment

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Shortage** | Price rises → Qs ↑, Qd ↓ |
| **Surplus** | Price falls → Qs ↓, Qd ↑ |

### Equilibrium Graph

```
    Price       S
      |        /
      |       / Surplus (Qs > Qd)
   P₂ |......X←←←←← Price too high
      |     /|\
   P* |..../.X..... ← EQUILIBRIUM
      |   / |\
   P₁ |../..X←←←←← Price too low
      | / Shortage (Qd > Qs)
      |/__________\_______ Quantity
              Q*     D

At P*: Qd = Qs = Q* (Market clears)
```

### Numerical Example: Coffee Market

| Price | Qd (millions) | Qs (millions) | Situation |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| $1.00 | 100 | 20 | Shortage (80) |
| $2.00 | 80 | 40 | Shortage (40) |
| $3.00 | 60 | 60 | **EQUILIBRIUM** |
| $4.00 | 40 | 80 | Surplus (40) |
| $5.00 | 20 | 100 | Surplus (80) |

**Equilibrium: P* = $3.00, Q* = 60 million cups**

## 📏 Elasticity

### Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Responsiveness of Qd to price changes |
| **Formula** | %ΔQd ÷ %ΔP |
| **Always negative** | But use absolute value |

### PED Formula

| Formula | |
|---------|--|
| **PED** | = (ΔQ/Q) ÷ (ΔP/P) |
| **Midpoint method** | = [(Q₂-Q₁)/((Q₁+Q₂)/2)] ÷ [(P₂-P₁)/((P₁+P₂)/2)] |

### Elasticity Categories

| Value | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **|Ed| > 1** | Elastic | Very responsive |
| **|Ed| = 1** | Unit elastic | Proportional response |
| **|Ed| < 1** | Inelastic | Not very responsive |
| **|Ed| = 0** | Perfectly inelastic | Vertical demand |
| **|Ed| = ∞** | Perfectly elastic | Horizontal demand |

### Determinants of PED

| Factor | More Elastic When |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Substitutes** | More substitutes available |
| **Necessity vs. luxury** | Luxury goods |
| **Time** | Longer time period |
| **Budget share** | Larger % of budget |
| **Definition** | Narrowly defined (Pepsi vs. soda) |

### Elasticity and Total Revenue

| If Demand Is | Price ↑ | Price ↓ |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Elastic** | TR ↓ | TR ↑ |
| **Inelastic** | TR ↑ | TR ↓ |
| **Unit elastic** | TR unchanged | TR unchanged |

### Total Revenue Test

| Change | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| **P↑ and TR↑** | Inelastic demand |
| **P↑ and TR↓** | Elastic demand |
| **P↑ and TR same** | Unit elastic |

### Elasticity Calculation Example

**Scenario**: Price of movie tickets rises from $10 to $12, quantity demanded falls from 1000 to 800.

**Using Midpoint Method:**
- %ΔQ = (800-1000)/((1000+800)/2) = -200/900 = -22.2%
- %ΔP = (12-10)/((10+12)/2) = 2/11 = 18.2%
- PED = |-22.2%/18.2%| = **1.22 (Elastic)**

**Total Revenue Test:**
- Before: $10 × 1000 = $10,000
- After: $12 × 800 = $9,600
- TR fell, so demand is elastic ✓

### Real-World Elasticity Examples

| Good | Estimated PED | Classification | Reason |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Insulin** | 0.03 | Highly inelastic | Life-saving necessity |
| **Gasoline (short-run)** | 0.3 | Inelastic | Few alternatives |
| **Gasoline (long-run)** | 0.7 | Less inelastic | Can buy efficient car |
| **Restaurant meals** | 1.6 | Elastic | Many alternatives |
| **Foreign travel** | 4.0 | Highly elastic | Pure luxury |
| **Salt** | 0.1 | Highly inelastic | Tiny budget share, no substitutes |
| **Coca-Cola** | 3.8 | Highly elastic | Many close substitutes |

### Total Surplus

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | CS + PS |
| **Maximized** | At equilibrium |
| **Allocative efficiency** | When total surplus is maximized |

### Calculating Surplus

| Shape | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| **Triangle** | ½ × base × height |
| **Rectangle** | base × height |
| **CS** | ½ × Q × (max price - equilibrium price) |
| **PS** | ½ × Q × (equilibrium price - min price) |

### Surplus Graph

```
    Price
      |
   Pmax|
      |\ Consumer Surplus
      | \   (triangle)
   P* |..\.........
      |  |\
      |  | \Producer Surplus
      |  |  \(triangle)    S
      |  |   \_________/
   Pmin|__|____________\_____ Quantity
           Q*           D
```

### Surplus Calculation Example

**Given:**
- Demand: P = 100 - 2Q
- Supply: P = 20 + Q
- Find equilibrium and surpluses

**Step 1: Find Equilibrium**
- 100 - 2Q = 20 + Q
- 80 = 3Q
- Q* = 26.67, P* = 100 - 2(26.67) = $46.67

**Step 2: Calculate Consumer Surplus**
- Max price (at Q=0): $100
- CS = ½ × 26.67 × (100 - 46.67) = ½ × 26.67 × 53.33 = **$711.11**

**Step 3: Calculate Producer Surplus**
- Min price (at Q=0): $20
- PS = ½ × 26.67 × (46.67 - 20) = ½ × 26.67 × 26.67 = **$355.56**

**Total Surplus = $711.11 + $355.56 = $1,066.67**

## 🎯 AP Exam Strategies

### Common Question Types

| Type | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Graph shifts** | Which curve; direction |
| **Calculate elasticity** | Use midpoint formula |
| **Surplus calculation** | Area of triangles |
| **Tax incidence** | Compare elasticities |

| **Producer Surplus** | ½ × Q × (P* - Pmin) |
| **Tax Revenue** | Tax per unit × Quantity sold |
| **DWL from tax** | ½ × Tax × (Q* - Qt) |

### AP Free Response Checklist

1. **Graph properly**: Label P (vertical), Q (horizontal), D, S
2. **Show original equilibrium**: P*, Q* at intersection
3. **Show shift correctly**: New curve, new equilibrium
4. **Shade areas**: CS, PS, DWL, Tax Revenue as appropriate
5. **Use arrows**: Show direction of changes

**Good luck on your AP Microeconomics exam! 🍀💹**

Remember: Supply and demand determine prices. Understanding elasticity tells you how markets respond to changes, and surplus analysis shows who benefits from trade!
