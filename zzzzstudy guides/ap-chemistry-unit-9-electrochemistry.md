## 🔢 Oxidation States

The **oxidation state** (or oxidation number) tracks electron transfer! 📊

### Rules for Assigning Oxidation States

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Free elements = 0 | Na, O₂, S₈ all = 0 |
| Monoatomic ions = charge | Na⁺ = +1, Cl⁻ = -1 |
| H = +1 (usually) | Exception: Metal hydrides (H = -1) |
| O = -2 (usually) | Exceptions: Peroxides (-1), F₂O (+2) |
| F = -1 (always) | Most electronegative element |
| Sum = 0 for neutral | Sum = charge for ions |

### Common Oxidation States

| Element | Typical States |
|---------|---------------|
| Alkali metals | +1 |
| Alkaline earth | +2 |
| Aluminum | +3 |
| Halogens | -1 (usually) |
| Transition metals | Variable! |

---

## 📝 Finding Oxidation States

### Example: H₂SO₄

- H = +1 (rule)
- O = -2 (rule)
- Find S:

$$2(+1) + S + 4(-2) = 0$$
$$+2 + S - 8 = 0$$
$$S = +6$$ ✅

### Example: MnO₄⁻

- O = -2
- Find Mn:

$$Mn + 4(-2) = -1$$
$$Mn - 8 = -1$$
$$Mn = +7$$ ✅

---

## 🔍 Identifying Redox Reactions

A reaction is redox if oxidation states CHANGE! 📈📉

### Example Analysis

$$2Mg(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2MgO(s)$$

| Species | Before | After | Change |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Mg | 0 | +2 | Oxidized (lost 2e⁻) |
| O | 0 | -2 | Reduced (gained 2e⁻) |

**This IS a redox reaction!** ✅

### Non-Redox Example

$$HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O$$

All oxidation states stay the same—just ion exchange! 
**NOT a redox reaction!** ❌

---

## 🧪 Oxidizing and Reducing Agents

### Identifying Agents

| If a species is... | It is the... | Because... |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Oxidized | Reducing agent | It reduces something else |
| Reduced | Oxidizing agent | It oxidizes something else |

### Example: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

- **Mg** is oxidized → Mg is the **reducing agent**
- **O₂** is reduced → O₂ is the **oxidizing agent**

### Common Oxidizing Agents

| Agent | Gets Reduced To |
|-------|-----------------|
| O₂ | O²⁻ |
| MnO₄⁻ (acidic) | Mn²⁺ |
| Cr₂O₇²⁻ (acidic) | Cr³⁺ |
| H₂O₂ | H₂O |
| HNO₃ | NO₂ or NO |
| Cl₂ | Cl⁻ |

### Common Reducing Agents

| Agent | Gets Oxidized To |
|-------|------------------|
| Metals (Zn, Fe, etc.) | Metal ions |
| H₂ | H⁺ |
| C | CO or CO₂ |
| S²⁻ | S |
| Fe²⁺ | Fe³⁺ |

---

## ⚖️ Balancing Redox Equations

### Half-Reaction Method (Acidic Solution)

**Step 1:** Separate into half-reactions

**Step 2:** Balance atoms other than O and H

**Step 3:** Balance O by adding H₂O

**Step 4:** Balance H by adding H⁺

**Step 5:** Balance charge by adding electrons

**Step 6:** Multiply to equalize electrons

**Step 7:** Add half-reactions and simplify

---

### Example: Balance in Acidic Solution

$$MnO_4^- + Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + Fe^{3+}$$

**Step 1:** Write half-reactions
- Reduction: MnO₄⁻ → Mn²⁺
- Oxidation: Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺

**Step 2:** Mn and Fe already balanced ✓

**Step 3:** Balance O with H₂O
- MnO₄⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O

**Step 4:** Balance H with H⁺
- 8H⁺ + MnO₄⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O

**Step 5:** Balance charge with e⁻
- 8H⁺ + MnO₄⁻ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O (left: +7+(-1)=-5e⁻ = +2 right)
- Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ + e⁻

**Step 6:** Multiply to equalize e⁻
- Reduction: ×1 (5 e⁻)
- Oxidation: ×5 (5 e⁻)

**Step 7:** Add and simplify
$$8H^+ + MnO_4^- + 5Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O + 5Fe^{3+}$$ ✅

---

### For Basic Solution

After balancing in acidic solution:
1. Add OH⁻ to both sides to neutralize H⁺
2. Combine H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O
3. Cancel excess water

### Electron Flow

- Electrons flow from **anode to cathode** through the wire
- **Cations** move toward the cathode in solution
- **Anions** move toward the anode in solution

---

## 📝 Cell Notation (Line Notation)

Standard way to represent a galvanic cell:

$$\text{Anode} | \text{Anode solution} || \text{Cathode solution} | \text{Cathode}$$

### Example: Zinc-Copper Cell

$$Zn(s) | Zn^{2+}(aq) || Cu^{2+}(aq) | Cu(s)$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Single line \| | Phase boundary |
| Double line \|\| | Salt bridge |
| Left side | Anode (oxidation) |
| Right side | Cathode (reduction) |

---

## ⚡ Standard Reduction Potentials (E°)

The **standard reduction potential** measures the tendency of a species to be reduced! 📈

### Common E° Values (at 25°C)

| Half-Reaction | E° (V) |
|---------------|--------|
| F₂ + 2e⁻ → 2F⁻ | +2.87 |
| Au³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Au | +1.50 |
| Cl₂ + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻ | +1.36 |
| Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag | +0.80 |
| Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu | +0.34 |
| 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ | 0.00 (reference) |
| Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Pb | -0.13 |
| Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Sn | -0.14 |
| Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni | -0.26 |
| Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Fe | -0.45 |
| Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn | -0.76 |
| Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al | -1.66 |
| Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Mg | -2.37 |
| Li⁺ + e⁻ → Li | -3.04 |

### Interpretation

| E° Value | Species tends to... |
|----------|---------------------|
| More positive | Be reduced (good oxidizing agent) |
| More negative | Be oxidized (good reducing agent) |

---

## 🧮 Calculating Cell Potential

### Standard Cell Potential (E°cell)

$$E°_{cell} = E°_{cathode} - E°_{anode}$$

Or equivalently:
$$E°_{cell} = E°_{reduction} - E°_{oxidation}$$

### Example: Zn-Cu Cell

- Cathode (reduction): Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu, E° = +0.34 V
- Anode (oxidation): Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻, E° = -0.76 V

$$E°_{cell} = (+0.34) - (-0.76) = +1.10 \text{ V}$$ ✅

### Spontaneity

| E°cell | Spontaneity |
|--------|-------------|
| Positive | Spontaneous (ΔG < 0) |
| Negative | Non-spontaneous (ΔG > 0) |
| Zero | At equilibrium |

---

## 🔄 Predicting Cell Reactions

### Which Species is Reduced?

The species with the **more positive E°** is reduced! 📈

### Example: Will Cu react with Zn²⁺?

Compare:
- Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu: E° = +0.34 V
- Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn: E° = -0.76 V

Cu²⁺ has higher E°, so Cu²⁺ would be reduced.
But the question asks if Cu metal reacts with Zn²⁺...

$$E°_{cell} = E°(Zn^{2+}/Zn) - E°(Cu^{2+}/Cu) = -0.76 - 0.34 = -1.10 \text{ V}$$

**E°cell is negative → NOT spontaneous!** Cu won't react with Zn²⁺. ❌

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Thermodynamics

### Connecting E° to ΔG°

$$\Delta G° = -nFE°_{cell}$$

| Symbol | Meaning | Value |
|--------|---------|-------|
| n | Moles of electrons transferred | From balanced equation |
| F | Faraday constant | 96,485 C/mol |
| E°cell | Standard cell potential | Volts |

### Example

For Zn-Cu cell (E°cell = 1.10 V, n = 2):
$$\Delta G° = -(2)(96485)(1.10)$$
$$\Delta G° = -212,000 \text{ J} = -212 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

Negative ΔG° confirms the reaction is spontaneous!

---

## 🔗 Connecting E° to K

$$E°_{cell} = \frac{RT}{nF}\ln K = \frac{0.0257}{n}\ln K$$

At 25°C:
$$E°_{cell} = \frac{0.0592}{n}\log K$$

### Example

If E°cell = 1.10 V and n = 2:
$$\log K = \frac{nE°}{0.0592} = \frac{(2)(1.10)}{0.0592} = 37.2$$
$$K = 10^{37.2} = 1.6 \times 10^{37}$$ ✅

Huge K confirms products are strongly favored!

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Anode = oxidation | AN OX |
| Cathode = reduction | RED CAT |
| E°cell = E°cat - E°an | Always this way! |
| Positive E° | Spontaneous |
| ΔG° = -nFE° | Links thermo to electro |

# 📐 The Nernst Equation

## 🌊 Beyond Standard Conditions

E°cell is for STANDARD conditions (1 M, 1 atm, 25°C). Real cells often differ! 📊

### The Nernst Equation

$$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q$$

At 25°C (298 K):
$$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} - \frac{0.0592}{n}\log Q$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Ecell | Actual cell potential |
| E°cell | Standard cell potential |
| n | Moles of electrons transferred |
| Q | Reaction quotient |
| R | 8.314 J/(mol·K) |
| F | 96,485 C/mol |
| T | Temperature (K) |

---

## 🧮 Using the Nernst Equation

### Example: Zn-Cu Cell

$$Zn(s) + Cu^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + Cu(s)$$

E°cell = 1.10 V, n = 2

If [Cu²⁺] = 0.010 M and [Zn²⁺] = 1.0 M:

**Step 1:** Write Q
$$Q = \frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Cu^{2+}]} = \frac{1.0}{0.010} = 100$$

**Step 2:** Apply Nernst equation
$$E_{cell} = 1.10 - \frac{0.0592}{2}\log(100)$$
$$E_{cell} = 1.10 - (0.0296)(2)$$
$$E_{cell} = 1.10 - 0.059 = 1.04 \text{ V}$$ ✅

---

## 📈 Effect of Concentration on E

### Key Principle

Changing concentration shifts Q, which changes E!

| Condition | Effect on Q | Effect on E |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Increase [products] | Q increases | E decreases |
| Decrease [products] | Q decreases | E increases |
| Increase [reactants] | Q decreases | E increases |
| Decrease [reactants] | Q increases | E decreases |

### Le Chatelier Connection

If you increase products, equilibrium shifts left → less driving force → lower E!

---

## ⚖️ At Equilibrium

When Q = K, the cell is at equilibrium:

$$E_{cell} = 0 \text{ (at equilibrium)}$$

This is when the battery is "dead"! 🔋💀

### Deriving the E°-K Relationship

At equilibrium: Ecell = 0 and Q = K

$$0 = E°_{cell} - \frac{0.0592}{n}\log K$$

$$E°_{cell} = \frac{0.0592}{n}\log K$$

---

## 🔋 Concentration Cells

A **concentration cell** has identical electrodes but different concentrations! 

### Setup

```
       Same metal on both sides!
    Anode     ||     Cathode
   (dilute)   ||    (concentrated)
     [M]low   ||      [M]high
```

### E° = 0, but E ≠ 0!

For a concentration cell:
- E°cell = 0 (same half-reactions)
- E = -(0.0592/n)log([dilute]/[conc])

### Example

Cu electrode in 0.010 M Cu²⁺ vs Cu electrode in 1.0 M Cu²⁺:

$$E = 0 - \frac{0.0592}{2}\log\left(\frac{0.010}{1.0}\right)$$
$$E = -0.0296 \times (-2) = 0.059 \text{ V}$$ ✅

The cell works because the system tries to equalize concentrations!

---

## 🌡️ Temperature Effects

The Nernst equation shows T dependence:

$$E_{cell} = E°_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q$$

At higher T:
- The correction term increases
- E deviates more from E°
- Equilibrium is affected

---

## 📊 Summary: Three Key Equations

| Equation | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| ΔG° = -nFE° | Free energy to cell potential |
| ΔG° = -RTlnK | Free energy to equilibrium |
| E° = (RT/nF)lnK | Cell potential to equilibrium |

### The Electrochemistry Triangle

```
       E°cell
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
   ΔG° ──── K
```

All three are connected!

---

## 🧮 Practice Problems

### Problem 1

For the cell: Pb|Pb²⁺(0.10 M)||Ag⁺(1.5 M)|Ag
E°(Pb²⁺/Pb) = -0.13 V, E°(Ag⁺/Ag) = +0.80 V

Find Ecell.

**Solution:**
$$E°_{cell} = 0.80 - (-0.13) = 0.93 \text{ V}$$

Reaction: Pb + 2Ag⁺ → Pb²⁺ + 2Ag, n = 2

$$Q = \frac{[Pb^{2+}]}{[Ag^+]^2} = \frac{0.10}{(1.5)^2} = 0.044$$

$$E = 0.93 - \frac{0.0592}{2}\log(0.044)$$
$$E = 0.93 - (0.0296)(-1.36)$$
$$E = 0.93 + 0.040 = 0.97 \text{ V}$$ ✅

---

### Problem 2

A concentration cell has [Ag⁺] = 0.0010 M at the anode and [Ag⁺] = 1.0 M at the cathode. Find E.

**Solution:**
$$E = 0 - \frac{0.0592}{1}\log\left(\frac{0.0010}{1.0}\right)$$
$$E = -0.0592 \times (-3) = 0.18 \text{ V}$$ ✅

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Nernst at 25°C | E = E° - (0.0592/n)logQ |
| Q expression | Same as equilibrium (products/reactants) |
| At equilibrium | E = 0, Q = K |
| Concentration cell | E° = 0, but E ≠ 0 |
| Higher products | Lower E |

## 🧪 Common Electrolysis Reactions

### Electrolysis of Molten NaCl

**At cathode (reduction):**
$$2Na^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Na(l)$$

**At anode (oxidation):**
$$2Cl^- \rightarrow Cl_2(g) + 2e^-$$

**Overall:**
$$2NaCl(l) \rightarrow 2Na(l) + Cl_2(g)$$

### Electrolysis of Water

Requires added electrolyte (like H₂SO₄) for conductivity!

**At cathode:**
$$4H^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2(g)$$

**At anode:**
$$2H_2O \rightarrow O_2(g) + 4H^+ + 4e^-$$

**Overall:**
$$2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2H_2(g) + O_2(g)$$

### Electrolysis of Aqueous NaCl (Brine)

Competing reactions! Water is easier to reduce than Na⁺.

**At cathode:** H₂O is reduced (not Na⁺)
$$2H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2(g) + 2OH^-$$

**At anode:** Cl⁻ is oxidized
$$2Cl^- \rightarrow Cl_2(g) + 2e^-$$

---

## 🔗 Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis

### First Law

The mass of substance produced is proportional to the charge passed!

$$m \propto Q$$

### Second Law

Equal amounts of charge produce masses in proportion to equivalent weights!

### The Key Equation

$$Q = It$$

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Q | Charge | Coulombs (C) |
| I | Current | Amperes (A) |
| t | Time | Seconds (s) |

### Moles of Electrons

$$n_{e^-} = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{It}{F}$$

Where F = 96,485 C/mol (Faraday constant)

---

## 🧮 Electrolysis Calculations

### Step-by-Step Method

1. Calculate charge: Q = It
2. Calculate moles of electrons: n(e⁻) = Q/F
3. Use stoichiometry to find moles of product
4. Convert to mass or volume

### Example: Electroplating Copper

How many grams of Cu are deposited by 5.0 A for 2.0 hours?

$$Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu$$

**Step 1:** Calculate charge
$$Q = It = (5.0 \text{ A})(2.0 \times 3600 \text{ s}) = 36,000 \text{ C}$$

**Step 2:** Moles of electrons
$$n_{e^-} = \frac{36,000}{96,485} = 0.373 \text{ mol}$$

**Step 3:** Moles of Cu (stoichiometry)
$$n_{Cu} = \frac{0.373}{2} = 0.187 \text{ mol}$$

**Step 4:** Mass of Cu
$$m = (0.187)(63.55) = 11.9 \text{ g}$$ ✅

---

### Example: Time Required

How long must 3.0 A flow to produce 5.0 L of O₂ at STP?

$$2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^-$$

**Step 1:** Moles of O₂
$$n_{O_2} = \frac{5.0}{22.4} = 0.223 \text{ mol}$$

**Step 2:** Moles of electrons (4 e⁻ per O₂)
$$n_{e^-} = 0.223 \times 4 = 0.893 \text{ mol}$$

**Step 3:** Charge needed
$$Q = n_{e^-} \times F = (0.893)(96,485) = 86,100 \text{ C}$$

**Step 4:** Time
$$t = \frac{Q}{I} = \frac{86,100}{3.0} = 28,700 \text{ s} = 8.0 \text{ hours}$$ ✅

---

## 📋 Strategy 1: Cell Potential Calculations

### The Formula

$$E°_{cell} = E°_{cathode} - E°_{anode}$$

### Step-by-Step

1. Identify what's reduced (more positive E°) → cathode
2. Identify what's oxidized → anode
3. Apply formula (DON'T multiply by coefficients!)
4. Check: E°cell should be positive for spontaneous

### Common Mistake ⚠️

**DON'T multiply E° by stoichiometric coefficients!**

E° is an intensive property—it doesn't change with amount!

---

## 📋 Strategy 2: Identifying Electrodes

### In Galvanic Cells

| To Find | Method |
|---------|--------|
| Cathode | Higher E° (more positive) |
| Anode | Lower E° (more negative) |
| Which is reduced | Compare E° values |
| Which is oxidized | Lower E° |

### From Cell Notation

$$\text{Anode} | \text{Anode ion} || \text{Cathode ion} | \text{Cathode}$$

**Left = Anode, Right = Cathode**

---

## 📋 Strategy 3: Thermodynamic Connections

### The Three Equations

| Equation | Use |
|----------|-----|
| ΔG° = -nFE° | E° to free energy |
| E° = (0.0592/n)logK | E° to equilibrium constant |
| ΔG° = -RTlnK | Complete the triangle |

### Quick Reference Values

- F = 96,485 C/mol (Faraday constant)
- R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)

## 📝 Answer Templates

### Template 1: Cell Potential

*"The cathode is [electrode] because it has the more positive standard reduction potential (E° = [value] V). The anode is [electrode] with E° = [value] V.*

*E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode = [calculation] = [answer] V*

*Since E°cell is [positive/negative], the reaction is [spontaneous/non-spontaneous]."*

### Template 2: Electrolysis Calculation

*"Charge passed: Q = It = ([current] A)([time] s) = [value] C*

*Moles of electrons: n = Q/F = [value]/96,485 = [value] mol*

*Using stoichiometry (from half-reaction [equation]):*
*Moles of product = [calculation]*

*Mass = (moles)(molar mass) = [answer] g"*

### Template 3: Nernst Equation

*"For the cell [notation], E°cell = [value] V, n = [value]*

*Q = [expression] = [calculation]*

*Using the Nernst equation at 25°C:*
$$E = E° - \frac{0.0592}{n}\log Q = [calculation] = [answer] \text{ V}$$"

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Calculation Errors

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Multiplying E° by n | Never multiply E° |
| Wrong sign for E°cell | E°(cathode) - E°(anode) |
| Forgetting time conversion | Use seconds! |
| Wrong n value | Count electrons in balanced equation |

### Conceptual Errors

| Mistake | Correct Understanding |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Larger E° = anode" | Larger E° = cathode (reduction) |
| "Positive electrode = anode" | In galvanic: anode is negative |
| "Electrolysis is spontaneous" | Electrolysis is forced (non-spont.) |
| "E changes with stoichiometry" | E is intensive (doesn't change) |

## 🧮 Practice FRQ

**Consider the cell:**
$$Sn(s) | Sn^{2+}(aq, 0.10 M) || Ag^+(aq, 1.0 M) | Ag(s)$$

E°(Sn²⁺/Sn) = -0.14 V, E°(Ag⁺/Ag) = +0.80 V

**(a)** Write the overall cell reaction.

**(b)** Calculate E°cell.

**(c)** Calculate ΔG° for this reaction.

**(d)** Calculate Ecell under the given conditions.

**(e)** If this cell operates for 1.5 hours at 2.0 A, what mass of Ag is deposited?

### Solutions

**(a)** 
Oxidation: Sn → Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻
Reduction: 2Ag⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2Ag

Overall: Sn(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq) → Sn²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s) ✅

**(b)**
$$E°_{cell} = E°_{cathode} - E°_{anode} = 0.80 - (-0.14) = 0.94 \text{ V}$$ ✅

**(c)**
n = 2 (2 electrons transferred)
$$\Delta G° = -nFE° = -(2)(96,485)(0.94) = -181,000 \text{ J} = -181 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**(d)**
$$Q = \frac{[Sn^{2+}]}{[Ag^+]^2} = \frac{0.10}{(1.0)^2} = 0.10$$

$$E = 0.94 - \frac{0.0592}{2}\log(0.10)$$
$$E = 0.94 - (0.0296)(-1) = 0.97 \text{ V}$$ ✅

**(e)**
Q = It = (2.0)(1.5 × 3600) = 10,800 C
n(e⁻) = 10,800/96,485 = 0.112 mol
n(Ag) = 0.112 mol (1 e⁻ per Ag)
m(Ag) = (0.112)(107.87) = 12.1 g ✅
