# 🎵 Unit 1: Music Fundamentals

## 📚 Unit Overview

Unit 1 establishes the foundational elements of music theory: pitch, rhythm, and notation. These concepts are essential for understanding all subsequent units.

---

## 🎼 1.1 The Staff and Clefs

### The Musical Staff

```
The STAFF consists of 5 lines and 4 spaces:

    5th line ─────────────────────────
    4th line ─────────────────────────
    3rd line ─────────────────────────
    2nd line ─────────────────────────
    1st line ─────────────────────────
              Space 1   2    3    4

Notes are placed ON lines or IN spaces.
Higher placement = higher pitch
```

### Treble Clef (G Clef)

```
TREBLE CLEF curls around the G line:

            𝄞
    ─F─────────────────
    ─D─────────────────
    ─B─────────────────  ← Middle line
    ─G─────────────────  ← G (clef circles here)
    ─E─────────────────
    
LINES: E G B D F
"Every Good Boy Does Fine"

SPACES: F A C E
"FACE" (spells a word!)
```

### Bass Clef (F Clef)

```
BASS CLEF dots surround the F line:

    𝄢
    ─A─────────────────
    ─F─────────────────  ← F (between dots)
    ─D─────────────────  ← Middle line
    ─B─────────────────
    ─G─────────────────
    
LINES: G B D F A
"Good Boys Do Fine Always"

SPACES: A C E G
"All Cows Eat Grass"
```

### Other Clefs

```
ALTO CLEF (C Clef - for viola):
Center of clef points to middle C

    ─G─────────────────
    ─E─────────────────
    ─C─────────────────  ← Middle C
    ─A─────────────────
    ─F─────────────────

TENOR CLEF (C Clef - for cello, bassoon):
Same symbol, different placement
Middle C on 4th line
```

### Ledger Lines

```
LEDGER LINES extend beyond the staff:

    ─ ─ ─ C ─ ─ ─  (High C - 2 ledger lines above treble)
    ─────────────────
    ─────────────────
    ─────────────────
    ─────────────────
    ─────────────────
    ─ ─ ─ C ─ ─ ─  (Middle C - 1 ledger line below treble)

Middle C is the same on both clefs:
- 1 ledger line BELOW treble staff
- 1 ledger line ABOVE bass staff
```

### The Grand Staff

```
GRAND STAFF combines treble and bass:

Treble  𝄞 ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
              ─C─  (Middle C)
Bass    𝄢 ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────
          ─────────────────

Used for piano and keyboard music.

## 🎹 1.2 Pitch and the Keyboard

### The Piano Keyboard

```
WHITE KEYS: C D E F G A B (natural notes)
BLACK KEYS: Sharps and flats

        ┌─┐   ┌─┐        ┌─┐   ┌─┐   ┌─┐
        │♯│   │♯│        │♯│   │♯│   │♯│
        │C│   │D│        │F│   │G│   │A│
┌───┬───┴┬┴───┴┬┴───┬───┬┴┬┴───┴┬┴───┴┬┴───┐
│   │    │     │    │   │ │     │     │    │
│ C │  D │  E  │  F │ G │A│  B  │  C  │    │
│   │    │     │    │   │ │     │     │    │
└───┴────┴─────┴────┴───┴─┴─────┴─────┴────┘

Pattern repeats: C D E F G A B C D E...
```

### Half Steps and Whole Steps

```
HALF STEP (semitone):
- Smallest interval on keyboard
- Adjacent keys (white to black OR white to white)
- Examples: E-F, B-C, C-C♯

WHOLE STEP (whole tone):
- Two half steps
- Skip one key
- Examples: C-D, D-E, F-G

         W  W  H  W  W  W  H
    C ─ D ─ E ─ F ─ G ─ A ─ B ─ C
    
Notice: Half steps between E-F and B-C
(No black key between them!)
```

### Accidentals

```
ACCIDENTALS modify pitch:

♯ SHARP: Raises pitch one half step
    C♯ is the black key above C

♭ FLAT: Lowers pitch one half step
    D♭ is the black key below D

♮ NATURAL: Cancels sharp or flat
    Returns to white key

ENHARMONIC EQUIVALENTS:
Same pitch, different names
    C♯ = D♭
    D♯ = E♭
    F♯ = G♭
    G♯ = A♭
    A♯ = B♭
```

### Double Accidentals

```
𝄪 DOUBLE SHARP: Raises two half steps
    C𝄪 = D natural

𝄫 DOUBLE FLAT: Lowers two half steps
    D𝄫 = C natural

Used in complex key signatures.
```

### Octave Identification

```
OCTAVE DESIGNATION:

    C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8
    └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
                 ↑
            Middle C = C4

Standard piano range: A0 to C8

A440: A above middle C (A4)
Standard tuning reference
```

## 🎶 1.3 Note Values and Rhythm

### Basic Note Values

```
NOTE VALUES (in common time):

𝅝  WHOLE NOTE      = 4 beats
    (open oval, no stem)

𝅗𝅥  HALF NOTE       = 2 beats
    (open oval with stem)

♩  QUARTER NOTE    = 1 beat
    (filled oval with stem)

♪  EIGHTH NOTE     = 1/2 beat
    (filled with flag)

𝅘𝅥𝅯  SIXTEENTH NOTE  = 1/4 beat
    (filled with 2 flags)
```

### Note Value Relationships

```
HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP:

1 Whole = 2 Halves = 4 Quarters = 8 Eighths = 16 Sixteenths

              𝅝
          /       \
        𝅗𝅥          𝅗𝅥
       /  \       /  \
      ♩    ♩     ♩    ♩
     /\   /\    /\   /\
    ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪

Each level divides by 2.
```

### Rests

```
RESTS (silences of same duration):

𝄻  WHOLE REST (hangs from line)     = 4 beats
𝄼  HALF REST (sits on line)         = 2 beats
𝄽  QUARTER REST (squiggle)          = 1 beat
𝄾  EIGHTH REST (flag pointing)      = 1/2 beat
𝄿  SIXTEENTH REST (2 flags)         = 1/4 beat

Memory tip:
- Whole rest is HEAVY, hangs DOWN
- Half rest is LIGHT, sits UP
```

### Dotted Notes

```
DOT adds half the value:

𝅗𝅥.  DOTTED HALF    = 2 + 1 = 3 beats
♩.  DOTTED QUARTER = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 beats
♪.  DOTTED EIGHTH  = 1/2 + 1/4 = 0.75 beats

DOUBLE DOT adds another quarter:

♩..  DOUBLE-DOTTED QUARTER = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1.75 beats

Formula: Note + 1/2 + 1/4 of original value
```

### Ties

```
TIES connect notes of same pitch:

♩ ─── ♩    = 2 beats (don't re-attack)

Uses:
1. Sustain across bar line
2. Create unusual durations
3. Show syncopation clearly

TIE vs. SLUR:
- Tie: Same pitch, adds duration
- Slur: Different pitches, play smoothly
```

### Beaming

```
BEAMING connects flagged notes:

Instead of: ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Write:      ♫ ♫    (beamed in groups)

RULES:
1. Beam within beats
2. Show beat divisions clearly
3. Groups of 2, 3, or 4 typically
4. Never beam across bar line (usually)

Common patterns:
2 eighths: ♫
4 sixteenths: ♬♬ (double beam)
```

## ⏱️ 1.4 Time Signatures and Meter

### Understanding Time Signatures

```
TIME SIGNATURE:

    4    ← Number of beats per measure
    ─
    4    ← Note value that gets ONE beat

Common examples:
    4/4: 4 quarter-note beats per measure
    3/4: 3 quarter-note beats per measure
    2/4: 2 quarter-note beats per measure
    6/8: 6 eighth-note beats per measure
```

### Simple Meter

```
SIMPLE METER: Beat divides into TWO

SIMPLE DUPLE (2 beats):
    2/4, 2/2 (cut time ₵)
    Strong-weak pattern
    Example: March

SIMPLE TRIPLE (3 beats):
    3/4, 3/8
    Strong-weak-weak pattern
    Example: Waltz

SIMPLE QUADRUPLE (4 beats):
    4/4 (common time ℂ)
    Strong-weak-medium-weak
    Example: Most pop music
```

### Compound Meter

```
COMPOUND METER: Beat divides into THREE

Top number divisible by 3 (but not 3 itself)

COMPOUND DUPLE:
    6/8 = 2 dotted-quarter beats
    Each beat divides into 3 eighths
    
COMPOUND TRIPLE:
    9/8 = 3 dotted-quarter beats

COMPOUND QUADRUPLE:
    12/8 = 4 dotted-quarter beats

CONDUCTING:
6/8: Conduct in 2, not 6
9/8: Conduct in 3
12/8: Conduct in 4
```

### Comparing Simple and Compound

```
SIMPLE vs. COMPOUND:

3/4                    6/8
│ ♩  ♩  ♩ │           │ ♪♪♪  ♪♪♪ │
  1  2  3               1     2

3/4: 3 beats, each divides by 2
6/8: 2 beats, each divides by 3

Same total value (6 eighths), different feel!
```

### Asymmetric Meter

```
ASYMMETRIC (Irregular) METER:
Not divisible evenly

5/4: Groups as 2+3 or 3+2
    │ ♩♩  ♩♩♩ │  or  │ ♩♩♩  ♩♩ │

7/8: Groups as 2+2+3, 2+3+2, or 3+2+2
    │ ♪♪  ♪♪  ♪♪♪ │

Examples:
- "Take Five" (5/4)
- Balkan folk music
- Stravinsky, Bartók
```

## 📏 1.5 Measures and Bar Lines

### Bar Lines

```
BAR LINE types:

│  Single bar line: Divides measures
║  Double bar line: Section end
│║ Final bar line: End of piece
║: Repeat signs
```

### Measure Structure

```
MEASURE (Bar):
Space between two bar lines

│  ♩  ♩  ♩  ♩  │  ♩  ♩  ♩  ♩  │
   Measure 1       Measure 2

Total beats must equal time signature.
In 4/4: Each measure = 4 beats
```

### Pickup Notes (Anacrusis)

```
PICKUP (Anacrusis):
Notes before first full measure

│ ♩ │ ♩  ♩  ♩  ♩ │ ♩  ♩  ♩  ♩ │
    Measure 1       Measure 2

First measure is incomplete.
Last measure often compensates:
│ ♩ │ ♩  ♩  ♩  ♩ │ ♩  ♩  ♩  ║
      Full         3 beats

Together = complete measure
```

```

---

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID:

1. CLEF CONFUSION
   - Always check the clef first
   - Same line = different note
   
2. REST DIRECTION
   - Whole rest hangs DOWN
   - Half rest sits UP

3. DOT MATH
   - Dot = half the note value
   - Not "one beat"

4. COMPOUND METER
   - 6/8 ≠ 3/4
   - Count the divisions!

5. ENHARMONIC AWARENESS
   - C♯ and D♭ sound the same
   - Context determines spelling
