code::=DISPLAY("Hello, World!")
DISPLAY("Welcome to AP CSP")
expected_output::=Hello, World!
Welcome to AP CSP
:::/CODE:::

### Variables and Assignment

:::CODE:::
id::=variables-example
title::=Working with Variables
language::=pseudocode
runnable::=false
code::=name ← "Alice"
age ← 17
score ← 95.5

DISPLAY(name)
DISPLAY("Age: ")
DISPLAY(age)
expected_output::=Alice
Age: 
17
:::/CODE:::

### User Input

:::CODE:::
id::=input-example
title::=Getting User Input

quotient ← a / b
remainder ← a MOD b

DISPLAY("Sum: ")
DISPLAY(sum)
DISPLAY("Remainder: ")
DISPLAY(remainder)
expected_output::=Sum: 
13
Remainder: 
1
:::/CODE:::

### String Concatenation

:::CODE:::

// Calculate area of rectangle 1
length1 ← 5
width1 ← 3
area1 ← length1 * width1

// Calculate area of rectangle 2
length2 ← 7
width2 ← 4
area2 ← length2 * width2

// Now we can simply call:

area3 ← rectangleArea(10, 6)

**Good luck on your AP Computer Science Principles exam! 🍀🖥️💡**

Remember: Program development is iterative - design, implement, test, refine, repeat! Collaboration improves programs through diverse perspectives. Always document your code for yourself and others. Testing is essential - test early and often!
