# 📊 Unit 2: Economic Indicators and the Business Cycle

## 📋 Unit Overview

Economic indicators tell us how the economy is performing. This unit covers GDP, unemployment, and inflation—the three main measures of economic health! 📈

| Indicator | Pre-Crisis (2007) | Worst Point | Recovery (2015) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Real GDP Growth** | 1.9% | -2.5% (2009) | 2.9% |

## 🧮 Detailed Calculation Examples

### Example 1: GDP Calculation

| Component | Amount (billions) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Consumer spending (C) | $15,000 |
| Gross investment (I) | $3,500 |
| Government purchases (G) | $3,200 |
| Exports (X) | $2,500 |
| Imports (M) | $3,100 |

**Calculate GDP:**
```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
GDP = $15,000 + $3,500 + $3,200 + ($2,500 - $3,100)
GDP = $15,000 + $3,500 + $3,200 + (-$600)
GDP = $21,100 billion
```

### Example 2: Real GDP from Nominal

| Year | Nominal GDP | GDP Deflator |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 2020 (base) | $21.0 trillion | 100 |
| 2023 | $27.4 trillion | 117.5 |

**Calculate Real GDP for 2023:**
```
Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator) × 100
Real GDP = ($27.4 trillion / 117.5) × 100
Real GDP = $23.3 trillion (in 2020 dollars)

Growth in Real GDP = ($23.3 - $21.0) / $21.0 × 100 = 11.0%
vs. Nominal Growth = ($27.4 - $21.0) / $21.0 × 100 = 30.5%

Difference = Inflation effect
```

### Example 3: Unemployment Rate

| Category | Number (millions) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Employed | 158.0 |
| Unemployed | 6.0 |
| Not in labor force | 100.0 |
| Adult population | 264.0 |

**Calculations:**
```
Labor Force = Employed + Unemployed = 158 + 6 = 164 million

Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100
Unemployment Rate = (6 / 164) × 100 = 3.66%

LFPR = (Labor Force / Adult Population) × 100
LFPR = (164 / 264) × 100 = 62.1%
```

### Example 4: Inflation Rate

| Year | CPI |
|------|-----|
| 2022 | 292.7 |
| 2023 | 304.7 |

**Calculate Inflation:**
```
Inflation Rate = [(CPI₂ - CPI₁) / CPI₁] × 100
Inflation Rate = [(304.7 - 292.7) / 292.7] × 100
Inflation Rate = (12 / 292.7) × 100 = 4.1%
```

### Example 5: Real Interest Rate

| Given | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Nominal interest rate | 7% |
| Expected inflation | 3% |

**Using Fisher Equation:**
```
Real interest rate = Nominal rate - Expected inflation
Real interest rate = 7% - 3% = 4%
```

## 📝 FRQ Practice: Unit 2

### Question 1: Classifying Unemployment

**For each scenario, identify the type of unemployment:**

**(a)** A coal miner loses their job due to the shift toward renewable energy.

**(b)** A recent college graduate is searching for their first job.

**(c)** A factory worker is laid off during a recession.

**(d)** A ski instructor is unemployed during summer months.

### Model Answer 1:

| Scenario | Type | Explanation |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **(a)** | Structural | Skills don't match new economy; industry decline |
| **(b)** | Frictional | Normal job search; new labor force entrant |
| **(c)** | Cyclical | Due to economic downturn; demand-deficient |
| **(d)** | Seasonal | Predictable pattern; weather-related |

---

### Question 2: GDP Analysis

**Using the following data for Country X:**
- Consumer spending: $800 billion
- Investment: $200 billion  
- Government purchases: $180 billion
- Exports: $100 billion
- Imports: $140 billion

**(a)** Calculate nominal GDP.

**(b)** If the GDP deflator is 125 (base year = 100), calculate real GDP.

**(c)** Does Country X have a trade surplus or deficit? Explain.

### Model Answer 2:

**(a)** 
```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
GDP = $800 + $200 + $180 + ($100 - $140)
GDP = $800 + $200 + $180 + (-$40)
GDP = $1,140 billion
```

**(b)**
```
Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator) × 100
Real GDP = ($1,140 / 125) × 100
Real GDP = $912 billion
```

**(c)** Country X has a **trade deficit** of $40 billion because imports ($140B) exceed exports ($100B). This means the country is consuming more foreign goods than it is selling abroad, and the net exports component is negative.

---

### Question 3: Inflation Winners and Losers

**Assume the expected inflation rate was 2%, but actual inflation turned out to be 5%.**

**(a)** Explain whether borrowers or lenders benefited, and why.

**(b)** What happens to workers with fixed-wage contracts?

**(c)** Using the Fisher equation, if the nominal interest rate was 6%, what was the expected real rate vs. actual real rate?

### Model Answer 3:

**(a)** **Borrowers benefited.** They repay loans with dollars that have less purchasing power than expected. If a borrower took a loan expecting 2% inflation, they expected to repay in dollars worth 98% of original value; instead, dollars are worth only 95%, making debt easier to repay in real terms.

**(b)** **Workers with fixed wages are hurt.** Their nominal wages stay the same, but prices rose faster than expected. Real wages = Nominal wages / Price level. As price level increases more than expected, purchasing power (real wages) falls.

**(c)** Fisher Equation calculations:
```
Expected real rate = Nominal - Expected inflation = 6% - 2% = 4%
Actual real rate = Nominal - Actual inflation = 6% - 5% = 1%
```
Lenders expected to earn 4% real return but only earned 1%.

## 🧠 Common Misconceptions Clarified

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "GDP includes all economic activity" | Excludes: non-market production, underground economy, used goods, intermediate goods |
| "Full employment means 0% unemployment" | Full employment = natural rate (frictional + structural), typically 4-5% |
| "CPI perfectly measures inflation" | CPI has biases: substitution, quality changes, new products |
| "Deflation is the opposite problem of inflation" | Deflation is often worse: increases debt burden, delays spending, hard to reverse |
| "A recession requires two negative quarters" | NBER uses broader criteria: significant decline in economic activity |
