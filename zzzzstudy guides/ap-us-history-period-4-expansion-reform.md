## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE way the Market Revolution changed American society.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The Market Revolution fundamentally changed the nature of work in America by shifting from artisan workshops to factory production. In factories like those at Lowell, Massachusetts, workers—many of them young women—worked long hours for wages under the supervision of managers. This represented a shift from skilled, independent craft work to wage-dependent, deskilled labor, creating new class distinctions between workers and owners."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE similarity AND ONE difference between the Second Great Awakening and the First Great Awakening.**

*Sample Answer:*
"A similarity between the two awakenings was their emphasis on emotional, personal religious experience over formal theology, with both featuring charismatic preachers who drew large crowds. A key difference was that the Second Great Awakening was closely linked to social reform movements; while the First Awakening focused primarily on individual salvation, the Second inspired movements like abolition, temperance, and women's rights, as believers sought to perfect society in preparation for Christ's return."
