## 🔋 Forms of Energy

### Types of Energy in Chemistry

| Type | Description | Symbol |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Kinetic | Motion of particles | KE |
| Potential | Stored (chemical bonds) | PE |
| Thermal | Related to temperature | q |
| Work | Force × distance | w |

### The First Law of Thermodynamics

$$\Delta E = q + w$$

| Symbol | Meaning | Sign Convention |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| ΔE | Change in internal energy | |
| q | Heat | + if INTO system |
| w | Work | + if done ON system |

**Energy is CONSERVED!** Energy cannot be created or destroyed! ⚖️

---

## 🌡️ Heat vs. Temperature

Don't confuse these! 🤔

| Concept | Definition | Units |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Heat (q) | Energy transfer | J or kJ |
| Temperature (T) | Average kinetic energy | K or °C |

**Analogy:** Temperature is like speed; heat is like distance traveled! 🚗

---

## 🔥 Exothermic vs. Endothermic

### Exothermic Reactions (ΔH < 0)

Energy is RELEASED to surroundings! 🔥

```
Reactants
    |
    | ← Energy released
    ↓
Products (lower energy)
```

**Examples:**
- Combustion: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + heat
- Neutralization: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O + heat
- Respiration: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + heat

### Endothermic Reactions (ΔH > 0)

Energy is ABSORBED from surroundings! ❄️

```
Products (higher energy)
    ↑
    | ← Energy absorbed
    |
Reactants
```

**Examples:**
- Photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
- Melting ice: H₂O(s) + heat → H₂O(l)
- Dissolving NH₄NO₃: Cold packs!

---

## 📊 Enthalpy (H)

**Enthalpy** is the heat content at constant pressure! 

$$\Delta H = H_{products} - H_{reactants}$$

### Sign Convention

| Sign | Meaning | Feels... |
|------|---------|----------|
| ΔH < 0 | Exothermic | Hot 🔥 |
| ΔH > 0 | Endothermic | Cold ❄️ |

### Enthalpy Diagram

**Exothermic:**
```
H
|  _____ Reactants
|    \
|     \  ΔH < 0
|      \______ Products
|
+------------------→ Reaction progress
```

**Endothermic:**
```
H
|       _____ Products
|      /
|     /  ΔH > 0
|    /
|  _____ Reactants
|
+------------------→ Reaction progress
```

## 🧪 Calorimetry

**Calorimetry** measures heat transfer! 📊

### Heat Equation

$$q = mc\Delta T$$

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| q | Heat | J |
| m | Mass | g |
| c | Specific heat capacity | J/(g·°C) |
| ΔT | Temperature change | °C or K |

### Important Specific Heats

| Substance | c [J/(g·°C)] |
|-----------|--------------|
| Water (l) | 4.184 |
| Ice | 2.09 |
| Steam | 2.01 |
| Aluminum | 0.897 |
| Iron | 0.449 |

🌟 **Water has HIGH specific heat!** Takes lots of energy to change its temperature!

---

## 🧮 Calorimetry Calculations

### Coffee Cup Calorimeter (Constant Pressure)

For aqueous reactions:

$$q_{reaction} = -q_{solution}$$
$$q_{solution} = m_{solution} \cdot c_{water} \cdot \Delta T$$

### Example Problem 📝

When 50.0 mL of 1.0 M HCl is mixed with 50.0 mL of 1.0 M NaOH, the temperature rises from 25.0°C to 31.9°C. Find ΔH per mole of water formed.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Find q for solution
- Total mass ≈ 100 g (assuming density = 1 g/mL)
- ΔT = 31.9 - 25.0 = 6.9°C
$$q = (100 \text{ g})(4.184 \text{ J/g·°C})(6.9°C) = 2887 \text{ J}$$

**Step 2:** q for reaction
$$q_{rxn} = -q_{solution} = -2887 \text{ J} = -2.89 \text{ kJ}$$

**Step 3:** Find moles of water formed
- mol HCl = (0.050 L)(1.0 M) = 0.050 mol
- mol H₂O formed = 0.050 mol

**Step 4:** Calculate ΔH per mole
$$\Delta H = \frac{-2.89 \text{ kJ}}{0.050 \text{ mol}} = -57.8 \text{ kJ/mol}$$ ✅

---

## 🌡️ Bomb Calorimeter (Constant Volume)

Used for combustion reactions! 💣

$$q_{rxn} = -C_{calorimeter} \cdot \Delta T$$

where C = heat capacity of the calorimeter (J/°C)

### Key Difference

| Calorimeter | Condition | Measures |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Coffee cup | Constant P | ΔH (enthalpy) |
| Bomb | Constant V | ΔE (internal energy) |

For most reactions: ΔH ≈ ΔE (difference is small)

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Sign of q | + into system, - out of system |
| Exothermic | ΔH < 0, feels hot |
| Endothermic | ΔH > 0, feels cold |
| q = mcΔT | Know water's c = 4.184 |
| Calorimetry | q(rxn) = -q(surroundings) |

# 🔄 Enthalpy of Reaction and Hess's Law

## 📊 Enthalpy of Reaction (ΔH°rxn)

The **standard enthalpy of reaction** is the enthalpy change when reactants in their standard states form products in their standard states! 📈

### Standard Conditions

| Property | Standard Value |
|----------|---------------|
| Temperature | 25°C (298 K) |
| Pressure | 1 atm (1 bar) |
| Concentration | 1 M (for solutions) |
| State | Most stable form |

---

## 🧪 Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH°f)

The **enthalpy of formation** is ΔH when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states! 🏗️

### Key Points

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Elements = 0 | ΔH°f for elements in standard state = 0 |
| Per mole | Always for 1 mole of compound |
| Compounds only | Elements don't have ΔH°f |

### Common ΔH°f Values (kJ/mol)

| Compound | ΔH°f |
|----------|------|
| H₂O(l) | -285.8 |
| H₂O(g) | -241.8 |
| CO₂(g) | -393.5 |
| CH₄(g) | -74.8 |
| C₆H₁₂O₆(s) | -1273 |
| NaCl(s) | -411.1 |
| NH₃(g) | -45.9 |
| C₂H₅OH(l) | -277.7 |

### Elements with ΔH°f = 0

- H₂(g), O₂(g), N₂(g), Cl₂(g), F₂(g), Br₂(l), I₂(s)
- C(graphite), S(s, rhombic), P(s, white)
- All metals in standard states

---

## 📐 Calculating ΔH°rxn from ΔH°f

$$\Delta H°_{rxn} = \sum n \cdot \Delta H°_f (products) - \sum n \cdot \Delta H°_f (reactants)$$

### Step-by-Step Method 📝

**Example:** Calculate ΔH°rxn for combustion of methane:
$$CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)$$

**Step 1:** List ΔH°f values
| Species | ΔH°f (kJ/mol) | Coefficient |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| CH₄(g) | -74.8 | 1 |
| O₂(g) | 0 | 2 |
| CO₂(g) | -393.5 | 1 |
| H₂O(l) | -285.8 | 2 |

**Step 2:** Apply formula
$$\Delta H°_{rxn} = [(1)(-393.5) + (2)(-285.8)] - [(1)(-74.8) + (2)(0)]$$
$$= [-393.5 - 571.6] - [-74.8]$$
$$= -965.1 + 74.8$$
$$= -890.3 \text{ kJ/mol}$$ ✅

---

## 🔄 Hess's Law

**Hess's Law:** If a reaction is the sum of two or more other reactions, ΔH is the sum of the ΔH values! ➕

$$\Delta H_{overall} = \Delta H_1 + \Delta H_2 + \Delta H_3 + ...$$

### Why It Works

Enthalpy is a **state function**—it depends only on initial and final states, not the path! 🛤️

```
         Path 1: Direct
    A ─────────────────→ D
     \                  ↗
      \  Path 2       /
       → B → C ──────/
```

Both paths give the same ΔH! 

---

## 📝 Hess's Law Problem-Solving Strategy

### The Rules

| If you... | Then... |
|-----------|---------|
| Reverse a reaction | Change sign of ΔH |
| Multiply by n | Multiply ΔH by n |
| Divide by n | Divide ΔH by n |

### Step-by-Step Method 🔢

1. Write the target reaction
2. Manipulate given reactions to match
3. Add up the ΔH values

---

## 📊 Worked Example

**Target reaction:**
$$2C(s) + H_2(g) \rightarrow C_2H_2(g) \quad \Delta H = ?$$

**Given reactions:**
1. $C_2H_2(g) + \frac{5}{2}O_2(g) \rightarrow 2CO_2(g) + H_2O(l)$ ΔH = -1299.6 kJ
2. $C(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)$ ΔH = -393.5 kJ
3. $H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$ ΔH = -285.8 kJ

### Solution

**Step 1:** Identify what's needed
- Need: 2C on left, H₂ on left, C₂H₂ on right

**Step 2:** Manipulate reactions
- Reaction 1: REVERSE (need C₂H₂ on product side)
  - $2CO_2(g) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow C_2H_2(g) + \frac{5}{2}O_2(g)$ ΔH = +1299.6 kJ

- Reaction 2: MULTIPLY BY 2 (need 2C)
  - $2C(s) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow 2CO_2(g)$ ΔH = 2(-393.5) = -787.0 kJ

- Reaction 3: Keep as is (need 1 H₂)
  - $H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$ ΔH = -285.8 kJ

**Step 3:** Add reactions and check
- CO₂ cancels: 2 on left, 2 on right ✅
- H₂O cancels: 1 on left, 1 on right ✅
- O₂ cancels: 5/2 on right, 2 + 1/2 on left = 5/2 ✅

**Step 4:** Sum ΔH values
$$\Delta H = +1299.6 + (-787.0) + (-285.8)$$
$$\Delta H = +226.8 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

## ⚗️ Bond Enthalpies

Another way to estimate ΔH! 🔗

$$\Delta H = \sum(\text{Bonds broken}) - \sum(\text{Bonds formed})$$

### Common Bond Enthalpies (kJ/mol)

| Bond | Energy | Bond | Energy |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| H-H | 436 | C-C | 347 |
| O=O | 498 | C=C | 614 |
| N≡N | 945 | C≡C | 839 |
| C-H | 413 | O-H | 463 |
| C-O | 358 | N-H | 391 |
| C=O | 799 | C-Cl | 339 |

### ⚠️ Limitations of Bond Enthalpies

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Average values | Actual values vary by molecule |
| Gas phase only | Values are for gaseous species |
| Approximate | Less accurate than ΔH°f method |

---

## 🎯 Comparing Methods

| Method | When to Use | Accuracy |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| ΔH°f values | Given ΔH°f data | Most accurate |
| Hess's Law | Given reaction ΔH values | Exact |
| Bond enthalpies | Estimate only | Approximate |

---

## 🧠 Practice Problem

Calculate ΔH for:
$$N_2H_4(l) + O_2(g) \rightarrow N_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)$$

Given: ΔH°f[N₂H₄(l)] = +50.6 kJ/mol

**Solution:**
$$\Delta H = [0 + 2(-285.8)] - [50.6 + 0]$$
$$\Delta H = -571.6 - 50.6$$
$$\Delta H = -622.2 \text{ kJ/mol}$$ ✅

Very exothermic! (Hydrazine is rocket fuel! 🚀)

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| ΔH°f for elements | Always = 0 in standard state |
| Hess's Law | Reverse = flip sign, multiply = multiply |
| Products - Reactants | ΔH = Σ(products) - Σ(reactants) |
| Bond enthalpies | Breaking = +, Forming = - |

# 🌀 Entropy and the Second Law

## 🎲 What is Entropy?

**Entropy (S)** is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system! 🎰

### Molecular Interpretation

Entropy measures the number of **microstates**—the different ways particles can be arranged while having the same total energy! 📊

$$S = k_B \ln W$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| S | Entropy |
| k_B | Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K) |
| W | Number of microstates |

---

## 📊 Entropy and Order

| Low Entropy (ordered) | High Entropy (disordered) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Solid ice cube 🧊 | Water vapor 💨 |
| Deck of cards (sorted) | Deck of cards (shuffled) |
| Crystal lattice | Gas molecules |
| Few microstates | Many microstates |

### Visual Comparison

**Low Entropy:**
```
• • • • •
• • • • •
• • • • •
(Ordered arrangement)
```

**High Entropy:**
```
  •     •
•    •   •
  •  •    •
(Random arrangement)
```

## 📈 Predicting Entropy Changes

### Factors that INCREASE Entropy

| Factor | Example | ΔS |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Phase change: s → l → g | Ice melting | + |
| More moles of gas | A → 2B (gases) | + |
| Temperature increase | Heating anything | + |
| Dissolving | NaCl(s) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) | Usually + |
| More complex molecules | Larger molecules | + |
| Mixing | Gases mixing | + |

### Factors that DECREASE Entropy

| Factor | Example | ΔS |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Phase change: g → l → s | Water freezing | - |
| Fewer moles of gas | 2A → B (gases) | - |
| Temperature decrease | Cooling | - |
| Precipitation | Ions → solid | - |

---

## 🔢 Comparing Moles of Gas

**Quick rule:** Count moles of gas on each side!

$$\Delta n_{gas} = n_{gas}(products) - n_{gas}(reactants)$$

| If Δn_gas... | Then ΔS... |
|--------------|------------|
| > 0 (more gas products) | > 0 (positive) |
| < 0 (fewer gas products) | < 0 (negative) |
| = 0 (same) | ≈ 0 (small) |

### Examples

**N₂O₄(g) → 2NO₂(g)**
- Δn_gas = 2 - 1 = +1
- ΔS > 0 (entropy increases) ✅

**N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)**
- Δn_gas = 2 - 4 = -2
- ΔS < 0 (entropy decreases) ✅

---

## 📊 Standard Molar Entropy (S°)

Unlike ΔH°f, elements DO have non-zero S° values! 

### Common S° Values (J/mol·K)

| Substance | S° |
|-----------|-----|
| H₂(g) | 130.7 |
| O₂(g) | 205.2 |
| N₂(g) | 191.6 |
| H₂O(l) | 69.9 |
| H₂O(g) | 188.8 |
| CO₂(g) | 213.8 |
| C(graphite) | 5.7 |
| Diamond | 2.4 |
| NaCl(s) | 72.1 |

### Trends in S°

| Observation | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| S°(gas) > S°(liquid) > S°(solid) | More freedom of motion |
| S° increases with molar mass | More microstates |
| S° increases with complexity | More ways to vibrate |
| S°(diamond) < S°(graphite) | Diamond is more ordered |

---

## 📐 Calculating ΔS°rxn

$$\Delta S°_{rxn} = \sum n \cdot S°(products) - \sum n \cdot S°(reactants)$$

### Example Calculation

**Calculate ΔS° for:**
$$2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O(l)$$

| Species | S° (J/mol·K) | n |
|---------|-------------|---|
| H₂(g) | 130.7 | 2 |
| O₂(g) | 205.2 | 1 |
| H₂O(l) | 69.9 | 2 |

$$\Delta S° = [2(69.9)] - [2(130.7) + 1(205.2)]$$
$$= 139.8 - 466.6$$
$$= -326.8 \text{ J/mol·K}$$ ✅

Negative ΔS makes sense: 3 moles gas → 2 moles liquid! 📉

---

## ⚖️ The Second Law of Thermodynamics

**The entropy of the UNIVERSE always increases for spontaneous processes!** 🌌

$$\Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{system} + \Delta S_{surroundings} > 0$$

### Key Insight

| System ΔS | Can Still Be Spontaneous If... |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Negative | ΔS_surroundings is more positive |
| Positive | Almost always helps spontaneity |

### Entropy of Surroundings

$$\Delta S_{surroundings} = -\frac{\Delta H_{system}}{T}$$

**Exothermic reactions** release heat, increasing S_surroundings! 🔥

---

## 🌡️ Temperature and Entropy

$$S = \frac{q_{rev}}{T}$$

At absolute zero (0 K): Perfect crystals have S = 0!

**Third Law of Thermodynamics:** The entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero! ❄️

### Why This Matters

- We can calculate ABSOLUTE entropies (S°)
- Unlike enthalpy, we know the "zero point"
- Elements have non-zero S° values

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Questions

**Q1:** Which has higher entropy: 1 mole of O₂ at 25°C or at 100°C?

**A:** At 100°C! Higher temperature = more molecular motion = more microstates = higher entropy! 📈

**Q2:** Why does dissolving NaCl increase entropy even though ΔH is slightly positive?

**A:** When NaCl dissolves, ions become dispersed throughout the solution, greatly increasing the number of microstates. The ion-dipole interactions with water molecules also create disorder! 💧

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Entropy = disorder | More microstates = higher S |
| Gases vs. solids | S°(g) >> S°(l) > S°(s) |
| Count gas moles | More gas products = + ΔS |
| S° ≠ 0 for elements | Unlike ΔH°f! |
| Universe entropy | Must increase for spontaneity |

# ⚡ Gibbs Free Energy and Spontaneity

## 🎯 What is Gibbs Free Energy?

**Gibbs free energy (G)** combines enthalpy and entropy to predict spontaneity! 🔮

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ΔG | Change in Gibbs free energy | kJ/mol |
| ΔH | Change in enthalpy | kJ/mol |
| T | Temperature | K (Kelvin!) |
| ΔS | Change in entropy | kJ/(mol·K) |

⚠️ **Unit Alert:** Convert ΔS from J to kJ if needed!

---

## ✅ Spontaneity Criterion

| ΔG | Meaning |
|----|---------|
| ΔG < 0 | Spontaneous (thermodynamically favored) ✅ |
| ΔG > 0 | Non-spontaneous (not favored) ❌ |
| ΔG = 0 | At equilibrium ⚖️ |

### What "Spontaneous" Really Means

| Spontaneous DOES mean... | Spontaneous DOES NOT mean... |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Thermodynamically favored | Fast |
| Can occur without input | Instantaneous |
| Products are more stable | Safe |

**Example:** Diamond → Graphite is spontaneous (ΔG < 0) but happens over billions of years! 💎

## 📊 The Four ΔH/ΔS Combinations

| ΔH | ΔS | ΔG = ΔH - TΔS | Spontaneity |
|----|----|---------------|-------------|
| - | + | Always - | Always spontaneous ✅ |
| + | - | Always + | Never spontaneous ❌ |
| - | - | Depends on T | Spontaneous at LOW T |
| + | + | Depends on T | Spontaneous at HIGH T |

### Visual Summary

```
       ΔS > 0              ΔS < 0
    +-----------+      +-----------+
ΔH  | Always    |      | Low T     |
< 0 | Spont. ✅ |      | Spont.    |

    +-----------+      +-----------+
ΔH  | High T    |      | Never     |
> 0 | Spont.    |      | Spont. ❌ |
    +-----------+      +-----------+
```

---

## 🌡️ Temperature Dependence

When ΔH and ΔS have the SAME SIGN, temperature matters!

### Finding the Crossover Temperature

At equilibrium: ΔG = 0

$$0 = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$
$$T = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}$$

This is the temperature where spontaneity switches! 🔄

### Example: Melting Ice

$H_2O(s) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$
- ΔH = +6.01 kJ/mol (endothermic)
- ΔS = +22.0 J/(mol·K) (more disorder)

$$T = \frac{6010 \text{ J/mol}}{22.0 \text{ J/(mol·K)}} = 273 \text{ K} = 0°C$$ ✅

Below 0°C: ΔG > 0 (freezing is favored)
Above 0°C: ΔG < 0 (melting is favored)

---

## 📐 Standard Free Energy Calculations

### Method 1: From ΔH° and ΔS°

$$\Delta G° = \Delta H° - T\Delta S°$$

### Method 2: From ΔG°f Values

$$\Delta G°_{rxn} = \sum n \cdot \Delta G°_f(products) - \sum n \cdot \Delta G°_f(reactants)$$

### Common ΔG°f Values (kJ/mol)

| Compound | ΔG°f |
|----------|------|
| H₂O(l) | -237.1 |
| H₂O(g) | -228.6 |
| CO₂(g) | -394.4 |
| CH₄(g) | -50.5 |
| NH₃(g) | -16.4 |
| C₆H₁₂O₆(s) | -910 |

**Note:** ΔG°f = 0 for elements in standard state (like ΔH°f)

---

## 📝 Worked Example

**Calculate ΔG° at 25°C for:**
$$2NO_2(g) \rightarrow N_2O_4(g)$$

**Given:**
- ΔH° = -58.0 kJ
- ΔS° = -176.6 J/K = -0.1766 kJ/K

**Solution:**
$$\Delta G° = \Delta H° - T\Delta S°$$
$$= -58.0 - (298)(-0.1766)$$
$$= -58.0 + 52.6$$
$$= -5.4 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

The reaction is spontaneous at 25°C! ✅

### What About at Higher T?

Find crossover temperature:
$$T = \frac{-58.0}{-0.1766} = 328 \text{ K} = 55°C$$

Above 55°C, this reaction becomes non-spontaneous! 📈

---

## ⚖️ Free Energy and Equilibrium

At equilibrium, ΔG = 0, but this applies to the actual reaction conditions, not standard state!

### Relationship to Equilibrium Constant

$$\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$$

| ΔG° | K value | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| ΔG° < 0 | K > 1 | Products favored |
| ΔG° > 0 | K < 1 | Reactants favored |
| ΔG° = 0 | K = 1 | Equal amounts |

### Calculating K from ΔG°

$$K = e^{-\Delta G°/RT}$$

**Example:** If ΔG° = -5.7 kJ/mol at 298 K:
$$K = e^{-(-5700)/(8.314)(298)} = e^{2.30} = 10$$ ✅

---

## 📊 Non-Standard Conditions

For non-standard conditions:

$$\Delta G = \Delta G° + RT \ln Q$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ΔG | Free energy at actual conditions |
| ΔG° | Free energy at standard conditions |
| Q | Reaction quotient |
| R | 8.314 J/(mol·K) |

### Interpreting ΔG

| Condition | ΔG | Direction |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Q < K | ΔG < 0 | Forward is spontaneous |
| Q > K | ΔG > 0 | Reverse is spontaneous |
| Q = K | ΔG = 0 | At equilibrium |

---

## 🔄 Coupled Reactions

A non-spontaneous reaction can be driven by a spontaneous one! 🚗

### Example: ATP Hydrolysis

**Non-spontaneous reaction:**
$$A \rightarrow B \quad \Delta G = +20 \text{ kJ}$$

**Coupled with ATP hydrolysis:**
$$ATP \rightarrow ADP + P_i \quad \Delta G = -30 \text{ kJ}$$

**Overall:**
$$A + ATP \rightarrow B + ADP + P_i \quad \Delta G = -10 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

The favorable ATP hydrolysis "drives" the unfavorable reaction! ⚡

## 📝 Problem Type 1: Complete Analysis

**Calculate ΔH°, ΔS°, ΔG° and predict spontaneity:**

$$2SO_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2SO_3(g)$$

**Given Data:**

| Species | ΔH°f (kJ/mol) | S° (J/mol·K) |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| SO₂(g) | -296.8 | 248.2 |
| O₂(g) | 0 | 205.2 |
| SO₃(g) | -395.7 | 256.8 |

### Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Calculate ΔH°**
$$\Delta H° = [2(-395.7)] - [2(-296.8) + 0]$$
$$= -791.4 - (-593.6)$$
$$= -197.8 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**Step 2: Calculate ΔS°**
$$\Delta S° = [2(256.8)] - [2(248.2) + 205.2]$$
$$= 513.6 - 701.6$$
$$= -188.0 \text{ J/K} = -0.188 \text{ kJ/K}$$ ✅

**Step 3: Calculate ΔG° at 298 K**
$$\Delta G° = -197.8 - (298)(-0.188)$$
$$= -197.8 + 56.0$$
$$= -141.8 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**Step 4: Analyze**
- ΔH < 0 (exothermic) ✅
- ΔS < 0 (fewer moles gas) ↓
- ΔG < 0 at 298 K (spontaneous) ✅
- Temperature dependent (same signs!)

**Step 5: Find crossover temperature**
$$T = \frac{\Delta H°}{\Delta S°} = \frac{-197.8}{-0.188} = 1052 \text{ K}$$

Above 1052 K, reaction becomes non-spontaneous! 🌡️

## 📝 Problem Type 2: Finding K from ΔG°

**Given ΔG° = -33.4 kJ/mol at 298 K, find K.**

$$\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$$

$$\ln K = \frac{-\Delta G°}{RT} = \frac{-(-33400)}{(8.314)(298)}$$

$$\ln K = \frac{33400}{2478} = 13.5$$

$$K = e^{13.5} = 7.2 \times 10^5$$ ✅

**Products are heavily favored!** 📈

---

## 📝 Problem Type 3: Finding ΔG° from K

**For the reaction H₂(g) + I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g), K = 54.3 at 700 K. Find ΔG°.**

$$\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$$
$$= -(8.314)(700) \ln(54.3)$$
$$= -5820(3.99)$$
$$= -23,200 \text{ J} = -23.2 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

---

## 📝 Problem Type 4: Non-Standard Conditions

**For N₂O₄(g) ⇌ 2NO₂(g):**
- ΔG° = +4.7 kJ at 298 K
- Initial conditions: P(N₂O₄) = 2.0 atm, P(NO₂) = 0.10 atm

**Is the forward reaction spontaneous under these conditions?**

**Step 1: Calculate Q**
$$Q = \frac{P_{NO_2}^2}{P_{N_2O_4}} = \frac{(0.10)^2}{2.0} = 0.005$$

**Step 2: Calculate ΔG**
$$\Delta G = \Delta G° + RT \ln Q$$
$$= 4700 + (8.314)(298) \ln(0.005)$$
$$= 4700 + (2478)(-5.30)$$
$$= 4700 - 13,130$$
$$= -8430 \text{ J} = -8.4 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**Even though ΔG° > 0, the reaction IS spontaneous at these non-standard conditions!** 🎉

## 📊 Practice Problem Set

### Problem 1: Spontaneity Analysis

Classify each reaction:

| Reaction | ΔH° (kJ) | ΔS° (J/K) | Spontaneity |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| A | -100 | +50 | ? |
| B | +50 | -30 | ? |
| C | -80 | -100 | ? |
| D | +120 | +200 | ? |

**Answers:**
- A: Always spontaneous (-, +) ✅
- B: Never spontaneous (+, -) ❌
- C: Low T spontaneous ⬇️
- D: High T spontaneous ⬆️

### Problem 2: Calculate ΔG

For C₂H₄(g) + H₂(g) → C₂H₆(g):
- ΔH° = -137.0 kJ
- ΔS° = -120.5 J/K

Find ΔG° at 25°C and 500°C.

**At 25°C (298 K):**
$$\Delta G° = -137.0 - (298)(-0.1205) = -101.1 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**At 500°C (773 K):**
$$\Delta G° = -137.0 - (773)(-0.1205) = -43.9 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

Still spontaneous, but less favorable at high T! 📉

## 🎯 Common AP Exam Questions

### Conceptual Questions

**Q1:** A reaction has ΔH° = +50 kJ and ΔS° = +150 J/K. At what temperature does it become spontaneous?

**A:** T > ΔH°/ΔS° = 50,000/150 = 333 K = 60°C

**Q2:** For an exothermic reaction at equilibrium, what happens when T increases?

**A:** 
- ΔG° becomes more positive (less negative)
- K decreases
- Equilibrium shifts toward reactants

**Q3:** Can a reaction with ΔG° > 0 ever occur spontaneously?

**A:** Yes! Under non-standard conditions where Q < K, ΔG can be negative even if ΔG° > 0.

## 📋 Strategy 1: Entropy Predictions

### The Quick Check Method

**Step 1:** Count moles of gas
$$\Delta n_{gas} = \text{moles gas products} - \text{moles gas reactants}$$

**Step 2:** Apply the rules

| Δn_gas | ΔS prediction |
|--------|---------------|
| > 0 | ΔS > 0 (positive) |
| < 0 | ΔS < 0 (negative) |
| = 0 | Small, consider phase changes |

### Phase Change Rules

| Process | ΔS |
|---------|-----|
| Solid → Liquid | + |
| Liquid → Gas | ++ (larger) |
| Dissolving ionic solid | Usually + |
| Dissolving gas | Usually - |

### Example Answer Template

*"The entropy change is [positive/negative] because [number] moles of gas are [formed/consumed], [increasing/decreasing] the number of microstates in the system."*

## 📋 Strategy 2: ΔG Calculations

### The Formula Decision Tree

```
What data is given?
      |
      ├─→ ΔH° and ΔS° → Use ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°
      |
      ├─→ ΔG°f values → Use Σ products - Σ reactants
      |
      ├─→ K value → Use ΔG° = -RT ln K
      |
      └─→ Q and ΔG° → Use ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
```

### Unit Conversion Checklist ✅

| Quantity | Must Be In... |
|----------|---------------|
| Temperature | Kelvin |
| ΔS | Same as ΔH (usually kJ) |
| R | Match units (8.314 J/mol·K) |
| ΔG | Typically kJ |

### Common Calculation Mistake

❌ Wrong: ΔG° = -300 kJ - (298 K)(+200 J/K)
✅ Right: ΔG° = -300 kJ - (298 K)(+0.200 kJ/K) = -359.6 kJ

---

## 📋 Strategy 3: Spontaneity Analysis

### Four-Quadrant Analysis

Draw this table for every problem:

| | ΔS > 0 | ΔS < 0 |
|-|--------|--------|
| **ΔH < 0** | Always spont. | Low T spont. |
| **ΔH > 0** | High T spont. | Never spont. |

### Finding Crossover Temperature

If ΔH and ΔS have the SAME SIGN:

$$T_{crossover} = \frac{|\Delta H°|}{|\Delta S°|}$$

**Below T_crossover:** ΔH dominates
**Above T_crossover:** TΔS dominates

---

## 📋 Strategy 4: Connecting ΔG° and K

### Key Relationships

$$\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$$

| ΔG° | K | Interpretation |
|-----|---|---------------|
| Very negative | Very large | Products strongly favored |
| Slightly negative | Slightly > 1 | Products slightly favored |
| Zero | 1 | Equal amounts |
| Slightly positive | Slightly < 1 | Reactants slightly favored |
| Very positive | Very small | Reactants strongly favored |

### Temperature Effects on K

From van't Hoff equation:
$$\ln\left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H°}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)$$

| ΔH° | Increasing T... |
|-----|-----------------|
| < 0 (exothermic) | K decreases |
| > 0 (endothermic) | K increases |

---

## 📋 Strategy 5: Hess's Law

### The Manipulation Rules

| Action | Effect on ΔH |
|--------|--------------|
| Reverse reaction | Change sign |
| Multiply by n | Multiply by n |
| Divide by n | Divide by n |

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. Write target reaction
2. Identify needed species on each side
3. Manipulate given reactions one at a time
4. Verify all intermediates cancel
5. Add up ΔH values

## 📝 Answer Templates for FRQs

### Template 1: Entropy Prediction

*"ΔS is [positive/negative] for this reaction because:*
- *[State phase changes if any]*
- *The number of moles of gas [increases/decreases] from [n₁] to [n₂]*
- *[Other factors: dissolution, complexity changes]"*

### Template 2: Spontaneity Explanation

*"The reaction is [spontaneous/non-spontaneous] at [temperature] because:*
- *ΔH = [value], which is [exothermic/endothermic]*
- *ΔS = [value], which [increases/decreases] disorder*
- *At this temperature, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = [calculation] = [value]*
- *Since ΔG [</>] 0, the reaction is [spontaneous/non-spontaneous]"*

### Template 3: Temperature Dependence

*"This reaction has [same/opposite] signs for ΔH and ΔS, so spontaneity [is/is not] temperature dependent.*
- *If dependent: The crossover temperature is T = ΔH/ΔS = [calculation]*
- *Below this T, [ΔH/TΔS] dominates and the reaction is [spont/non-spont]*
- *Above this T, [ΔH/TΔS] dominates and the reaction is [spont/non-spont]"*

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Calculation Errors

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using °C | Convert to K: T(K) = T(°C) + 273 |
| J/K vs kJ/K | Convert ΔS to kJ/K to match ΔH |
| Sign errors | Check: exothermic = negative ΔH |
| Wrong R value | Use 8.314 J/(mol·K) |

### Conceptual Errors

| Mistake | Correct Understanding |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Spontaneous = fast" | Spontaneous = thermodynamically favored |
| "ΔS always matters more at high T" | Only when ΔH and ΔS have same sign |
| "Exothermic = spontaneous" | Not always! Need to check ΔG |
| "ΔG° = ΔG" | ΔG° is at standard conditions only |

---

## 🧮 Quick Reference Equations

| Equation | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| $\Delta G° = \Delta H° - T\Delta S°$ | Main calculation |
| $\Delta G° = \Sigma \Delta G°_f(products) - \Sigma \Delta G°_f(reactants)$ | Given ΔG°f |
| $\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$ | Given K or finding K |
| $\Delta G = \Delta G° + RT \ln Q$ | Non-standard conditions |
| $T = \Delta H / \Delta S$ | Crossover temperature |

## 📊 Practice FRQ

**Consider the reaction:**
$$CaCO_3(s) \rightarrow CaO(s) + CO_2(g)$$

| Species | ΔH°f (kJ/mol) | S° (J/mol·K) |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| CaCO₃(s) | -1207.6 | 91.7 |
| CaO(s) | -634.9 | 38.1 |
| CO₂(g) | -393.5 | 213.8 |

**(a)** Calculate ΔH° for the reaction.

**(b)** Calculate ΔS° for the reaction. Justify the sign.

**(c)** Calculate ΔG° at 25°C. Is the reaction spontaneous?

**(d)** At what temperature does this reaction become spontaneous?

### Solution

**(a) ΔH°:**
$$\Delta H° = [-634.9 + (-393.5)] - [-1207.6]$$
$$= -1028.4 + 1207.6 = +179.2 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

**(b) ΔS°:**
$$\Delta S° = [38.1 + 213.8] - [91.7]$$
$$= 251.9 - 91.7 = +160.2 \text{ J/K}$$ ✅

*Positive because 1 mole of gas is produced from a solid.*

**(c) ΔG° at 298 K:**
$$\Delta G° = 179.2 - (298)(0.1602)$$
$$= 179.2 - 47.7 = +131.5 \text{ kJ}$$ ✅

*Not spontaneous at 25°C (ΔG° > 0)*

**(d) Crossover temperature:**
$$T = \frac{\Delta H°}{\Delta S°} = \frac{179200 \text{ J}}{160.2 \text{ J/K}}$$
$$= 1119 \text{ K} = 846°C$$ ✅

*Above 846°C, the decomposition becomes spontaneous!*
