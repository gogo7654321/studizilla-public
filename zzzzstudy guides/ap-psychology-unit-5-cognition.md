# 🧠 Memory Encoding and Storage

## 🎯 What Is Memory?

The persistence of learning over time! 📚

### Three Memory Processes

| Process | Definition | Analogy |

| **Encoding** | Getting info in | Typing on keyboard |
| **Storage** | Maintaining info | Saving to hard drive |
| **Retrieval** | Getting info out | Opening a file |

## 📋 Memory Models

### Atkinson-Shiffrin Model (1968)

```
Sensory Memory → Short-Term Memory → Long-Term Memory
    (brief)         (limited)           (permanent)
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
   Unattended       Unrehearsed          Retrieval
   info lost        info lost            success/failure
```

### Three Stages

| Stage | Duration | Capacity | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Sensory** | Fractions of a second | Large | Brief recording |
| **Short-Term** | ~20 seconds | 7 ± 2 items | Working memory |
| **Long-Term** | Years to lifetime | Unlimited | Permanent storage |

---

## 👁️ Sensory Memory

### Types of Sensory Memory

| Type | Sense | Duration |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Iconic** | Visual | ~0.5 seconds |
| **Echoic** | Auditory | ~3-4 seconds |

### Sperling's Experiment (1960)

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Method | Flashed letters briefly |
| Whole report | ~4 letters recalled |
| Partial report | High accuracy if cued immediately |
| Conclusion | Sensory memory large but brief |

## 💭 Short-Term/Working Memory

### Characteristics

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Duration | ~20 seconds without rehearsal |
| Capacity | 7 ± 2 items (Miller's magic number) |
| Function | Active processing of info |

# 🔍 Memory Retrieval and Forgetting

## 🎯 Retrieval Basics

Getting memories out! 📤

### Types of Retrieval

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Recall** | Retrieve without cues | Essay question |
| **Recognition** | Identify previously learned | Multiple choice |
| **Relearning** | Learn faster second time | Studying for cumulative exam |

### Retrieval Cues

Anything that helps trigger a memory!

## 📊 Retrieval Phenomena

### Serial Position Effect

| Effect | Definition | Explanation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Primacy** | Remember first items | Rehearsed to LTM |
| **Recency** | Remember last items | Still in STM |

```
Recall
  ^
  │    ╭╮                    ╭╮
  │   ╭╯╰╮                  ╭╯╰╮
  │  ╭╯  ╰╮                ╭╯  │

  └──┴──────────────────────────→
     First        Middle      Last
          Position in List
```

### Context-Dependent Memory

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Encoding specificity** | Cues present at encoding help retrieval | Study in same room as test |
| **State-dependent** | Internal state matters | Mood, intoxication |
| **Context-dependent** | External environment matters | Same location |

### Priming

| Definition | Activation of associations |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Example | Seeing "nurse" makes "doctor" faster |
| Type | Implicit memory |

## 🚫 Forgetting

### Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

```

    │ ╲
 50%│  ╲_____
    │        ─────────────────
    └────────────────────────→
      20min  1hr   1day   1mo
                Time
```

### Key Finding

Most forgetting happens quickly after learning, then levels off.

---

## ❓ Why Do We Forget?

### Theories of Forgetting

| Theory | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Encoding failure** | Never properly encoded |
| **Storage decay** | Memory trace fades |
| **Retrieval failure** | Can't access stored memory |
| **Interference** | Other memories block retrieval |

### Interference Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Proactive** | Old interferes with new | Old phone # blocks new |
| **Retroactive** | New interferes with old | New password blocks old |

### Memory Aid

- **Pro**active = **P**revious blocks new
- **Retro**active = **R**ecent blocks old

---

## 🧪 Memory Distortion

|----------|-----------------|
| "Smashed into" | Higher speed |
| "Hit" | Lower speed |
| "Contacted" | Lowest speed |

### Source Amnesia

- Eyewitness testimony can be unreliable
- Confidence ≠ Accuracy

---

## 📉 Amnesia

### Types of Amnesia

| Type | Definition | Damage |
|------|------------|--------|

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: Sara is studying for an important exam. Using your knowledge of memory, explain how each of the following could affect her performance:

(a) Spacing effect
(b) Context-dependent memory
(c) Semantic encoding
(d) Proactive interference
(e) Testing effect

**Answer**:

(a) **Spacing effect**: If Sara spreads her studying over several days rather than cramming the night before, she will have better retention. The spacing effect shows that distributed practice leads to stronger, more durable memories than massed practice. This allows time for consolidation and creates more retrieval opportunities.

(b) **Context-dependent memory**: If Sara studies in an environment similar to where she will take the exam (same room, similar lighting, same desk), she may recall information better. Context-dependent memory suggests that retrieval is enhanced when the physical context during encoding matches the context during retrieval.

(c) **Semantic encoding**: If Sara focuses on understanding the meaning of the material rather than just memorizing facts superficially, she will remember more. Deep processing (semantic level) creates stronger memory traces than shallow processing (just reading words). Connecting new information to existing knowledge improves retention.

(d) **Proactive interference**: If Sara has previously learned similar but different material, that old learning may interfere with her ability to recall the new information. For example, if she learned different formulas in a previous course, those old formulas might intrude when she tries to remember the new ones.

(e) **Testing effect**: If Sara quizzes herself while studying rather than just rereading her notes, she will remember more on the actual exam. The act of retrieving information strengthens memory more than passive review. Practice tests also help identify gaps in knowledge.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Confusing STM and working memory | STM = storage; Working memory = processing |
| Proactive vs. retroactive | Pro = prior interferes; Retro = recent interferes |
| Availability vs. representativeness | Availability = ease of recall; Representative = similarity |
| Phonemes vs. morphemes | Phonemes = sounds; Morphemes = meaning units |

## 📋 Unit 5 Checklist

### Before the Exam

✅ Know three stages of Atkinson-Shiffrin model
✅ Distinguish explicit from implicit memory
✅ Understand encoding strategies (levels of processing, chunking)
✅ Know serial position effect
✅ Differentiate proactive from retroactive interference
✅ Understand misinformation effect and false memories
✅ Know problem-solving heuristics vs. algorithms
✅ Identify cognitive biases (availability, representativeness, confirmation)
✅ Know language development stages
✅ Compare Chomsky vs. Skinner on language
✅ Understand theories of intelligence

## 📊 Quick Comparison

### Interference Types

| Feature | Proactive | Retroactive |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Direction | Old → New | New → Old |
| Example | Old password blocks new | New password blocks old |
| Memory | Pro = Prior | Retro = Recent |

### Memory Types

| Explicit | Implicit |
|----------|----------|
| Conscious | Unconscious |
| Hippocampus | Cerebellum/basal ganglia |
| Episodic + semantic | Procedural + conditioning |

## 💡 Memory Aids

### Three Memory Processes

**E**-**S**-**R** = **E**ncoding, **S**torage, **R**etrieval

### Interference

- **Pro**active = **P**revious (past blocks present)
- **Retro**active = **R**ecent (recent blocks old)

### Heuristics

- **A**vailability = What's **A**ccessible in memory
- **R**epresentativeness = **R**esemblance to prototype

### Language Levels

**P**-**M**: **P**honemes = sounds, **M**orphemes = meaning

**Good luck! 🍀**
