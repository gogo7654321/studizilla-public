---

## 🎯 Scarcity and Choice

### The Fundamental Economic Problem

The core problem in economics stems from the fact that human wants are unlimited, but resources are finite. Every society must make choices about how to allocate these limited resources.

**Real-World Example: US Federal Budget 2023**
- Total spending: $6.13 trillion
- Defense: $816 billion (13%)
- Social Security: $1.35 trillion (22%)
- Medicare/Medicaid: $1.59 trillion (26%)
- Each dollar spent on defense cannot be spent on healthcare!

### Scarcity

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Resources are limited; wants are unlimited |
| **Universal** | Applies to all societies |
| **Necessitates choice** | Must decide what to produce |
| **Creates trade-offs** | Choosing one means giving up another |

### Real-World Scarcity Examples

| Resource | Scarcity Issue | Economic Impact |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Fresh Water** | Only 2.5% of Earth's water is fresh | Agriculture uses 70% of freshwater globally |
| **Crude Oil** | Estimated 1.7 trillion barrels remaining | Drives energy prices and geopolitics |
| **Rare Earth Metals** | China controls 60% of production | Critical for electronics and green technology |
| **Time** | 24 hours per day | Opportunity cost of every activity |
| **Healthcare Workers** | Limited training capacity | Nursing shortages during COVID-19 pandemic |

### Factors of Production

| Factor | Description | Payment |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Land** | Natural resources | Rent |
| **Labor** | Human effort | Wages |
| **Capital** | Tools, machinery, equipment | Interest |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Organizes production; takes risk | Profit |

### Types of Capital

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Physical capital** | Tools; machinery; buildings |
| **Human capital** | Skills; education; training |
| **Financial capital** | Money; NOT a factor of production |

### Factor Payments in the US Economy (2023)

| Factor | Payment Type | Share of National Income | Dollar Amount |
|--------|--------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Labor** | Wages & Salaries | ~62% | $14.5 trillion |
| **Capital** | Interest & Profits | ~25% | $5.8 trillion |
| **Land** | Rent | ~4% | $0.9 trillion |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Profits | ~9% | $2.1 trillion |

### Economic vs. Free Goods

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Economic goods** | Scarce; have opportunity cost |
| **Free goods** | Abundant; no opportunity cost (rare) |

---

## 💰 Opportunity Cost

### Definition

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Opportunity cost** | Value of the next best alternative forgone |
| **Explicit costs** | Actual monetary payments |
| **Implicit costs** | Value of resources you already own |
| **Total cost** | Explicit + implicit costs |

### Calculating Opportunity Cost

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Given up option** | Value of what you sacrifice |
| **Time** | What you could have done instead |
| **Resources** | Alternative uses |

### Examples

| Decision | Opportunity Cost |
|----------|------------------|
| **Going to college** | Wages you could have earned |
| **Buying a car** | Other uses for that money |
| **Studying economics** | Time not spent on other subjects |
| **Using land for parking** | Building that could be there |

### Marginal Analysis

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Marginal** | Additional; one more unit |
| **Marginal benefit (MB)** | Additional benefit from one more |
| **Marginal cost (MC)** | Additional cost of one more |
| **Decision rule** | Do it if MB ≥ MC |

### Optimal Decision-Making

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Continue activity** | While MB > MC |
| **Stop activity** | When MC > MB |
| **Optimal point** | Where MB = MC |

### Real-World Marginal Analysis Example: Coffee Shop

| Cup # | Marginal Benefit | Marginal Cost | Decision |
|-------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| 1st | $5.00 (really want it) | $4.00 | Buy it! (MB > MC) |
| 2nd | $3.00 (still good) | $4.00 | Don't buy (MC > MB) |
| 3rd | $1.50 (getting jittery) | $4.00 | Definitely no |

### Sunk Costs

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Costs already incurred that cannot be recovered |
| **Rule** | Should NOT affect future decisions |
| **Example** | Movie ticket already purchased - stay or leave based on enjoyment, not ticket price |
| **Common mistake** | "I paid for it, so I must use it" (sunk cost fallacy) |

## 📊 Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)

### What is the PPC?

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Shows maximum output combinations |
| **Assumptions** | Fixed resources; fixed technology |
| **Two goods** | Shows trade-off between them |
| **Curve** | Usually bowed outward (concave) |

### Points on the PPC

| Location | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **On the curve** | Efficient; full employment |
| **Inside the curve** | Inefficient; underemployment |
| **Outside the curve** | Unattainable (currently) |

### PPC Shape and Interpretation

| Shape | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| **Bowed outward** | Increasing opportunity cost |
| **Straight line** | Constant opportunity cost |
| **Reason for curve** | Resources not equally suited |

### Increasing Opportunity Cost

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Law of increasing opportunity cost** | As production increases, OC rises |
| **Reason** | Resources are specialized |
| **Example** | Land better for wheat than computers |

### PPC Shifts

| Shift | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| **Outward (right)** | Economic growth |
| **Inward (left)** | Resource destruction |

### Causes of Economic Growth

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **More resources** | Shift outward |
| **Better technology** | Shift outward |
| **More capital** | Shift outward |
| **Education/training** | Shift outward |

### Biased Growth

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Biased toward Good A** | More A can be produced; curve shifts more on A axis |
| **Technology in one sector** | Affects that good more |

### PPC Graph Description

```
           Butter
              |
         A    |  
              |. . . B (on curve - efficient)
              |     .
              |  C .   (inside - inefficient/unemployment)
              |   .
              |  .
              | .
              |__________________ Guns
                       D (outside - unattainable)
```

**Key Graph Features:**
- **Y-axis**: Good A (e.g., Butter - consumer goods)
- **X-axis**: Good B (e.g., Guns - military goods)
- **Bowed-out shape**: Reflects increasing opportunity cost
- **Any point on curve**: Productive efficiency achieved
- **Movement along curve**: Trade-off with opportunity cost

### PPC Numerical Example

| Combination | Consumer Goods | Capital Goods | OC of 1 More Capital Good |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| A | 100 | 0 | - |
| B | 90 | 10 | 1 consumer good |
| C | 70 | 20 | 2 consumer goods |
| D | 40 | 30 | 3 consumer goods |
| E | 0 | 40 | 4 consumer goods |

**Notice:** Opportunity cost INCREASES as we produce more capital goods (1→2→3→4)

## 🔄 Comparative and Absolute Advantage

### Absolute Advantage

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Produce more with same resources |
| **OR** | Same output with fewer resources |
| **Not basis for trade** | Comparative advantage matters |

### Comparative Advantage

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Lower opportunity cost |
| **Basis for trade** | Specialize in what you do best |
| **Everyone has one** | Even if no absolute advantage |

### Calculating Comparative Advantage

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| **1** | Calculate opportunity cost for each |
| **2** | Compare opportunity costs |
| **3** | Lower OC = comparative advantage |

### Example Calculation

| Country | Wheat | Cloth | OC of Wheat | OC of Cloth |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **A** | 10 | 20 | 2 cloth | 0.5 wheat |
| **B** | 8 | 8 | 1 cloth | 1 wheat |

| Analysis | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Absolute in wheat** | A (10 > 8) |
| **Absolute in cloth** | A (20 > 8) |
| **Comparative in wheat** | B (1 < 2 cloth) |
| **Comparative in cloth** | A (0.5 < 1 wheat) |

### Gains from Trade

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Specialization** | Each produces what they do best |
| **Trade** | Exchange for other goods |
| **Mutual benefit** | Both parties gain |
| **Terms of trade** | Must be between opportunity costs |

### Terms of Trade

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Must be between** | The two opportunity costs |
| **Example** | If OC is 0.5 and 1, trade at 0.75 |
| **Both gain** | When within this range |

### Extended Trade Example: US and Japan

**Production per worker per day:**

| Country | Cars | Computers |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **US** | 4 | 8 |
| **Japan** | 6 | 6 |

**Step 1: Calculate Opportunity Costs**

| Country | OC of 1 Car | OC of 1 Computer |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **US** | 8/4 = 2 computers | 4/8 = 0.5 cars |
| **Japan** | 6/6 = 1 computer | 6/6 = 1 car |

**Step 2: Determine Comparative Advantage**
- **US**: Comparative advantage in COMPUTERS (OC = 0.5 cars < 1 car for Japan)
- **Japan**: Comparative advantage in CARS (OC = 1 computer < 2 computers for US)

**Step 3: Terms of Trade**
- For cars: Between 1 and 2 computers per car
- Mutually beneficial: 1.5 computers per car

**Step 4: Gains from Trade**
- US specializes in computers, trades for cars
- Japan specializes in cars, trades for computers
- Both consume beyond their individual PPCs!

### Real-World Comparative Advantage Examples

| Country/Region | Comparative Advantage | Reason |
|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Saudi Arabia** | Oil production | Vast oil reserves, low extraction costs |
| **China** | Manufacturing | Large labor force, infrastructure |
| **Switzerland** | Financial services | Stability, expertise, privacy laws |
| **India** | IT services | English-speaking, educated workforce |
| **Brazil** | Agricultural products | Climate, arable land, low costs |

## 📊 Practice Problems

### PPC Interpretation

| Scenario | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Point inside curve** | Inefficient; unemployment |
| **Move along curve** | Trade-off; opportunity cost |
| **Curve shifts out** | Economic growth |

### Comparative Advantage

| Given | Find |
|-------|------|
| **Output tables** | Calculate OC for each |
| **Input tables** | Calculate OC (flip) for each |
| **Compare OCs** | Lower OC = advantage |

### Practice Problem 1: PPC Analysis

Country X can produce:
- 100 units of food OR 50 units of clothing
- Or any linear combination

**Questions:**
1. What is the opportunity cost of 1 unit of clothing?
   - Answer: 100/50 = 2 units of food
2. What is the opportunity cost of 1 unit of food?
   - Answer: 50/100 = 0.5 units of clothing
3. What shape is this PPC?
   - Answer: Straight line (constant opportunity cost)

### Practice Problem 2: Trade Analysis

| Country | Wheat (bushels/day) | Steel (tons/day) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Alpha** | 60 | 30 |
| **Beta** | 40 | 20 |

**Who has comparative advantage in wheat?**
- Alpha's OC of wheat: 30/60 = 0.5 steel
- Beta's OC of wheat: 20/40 = 0.5 steel
- **Answer**: Neither! Same opportunity cost - no gains from trade
