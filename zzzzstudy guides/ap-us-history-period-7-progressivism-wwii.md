## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE goal of Progressive reformers AND ONE method they used to achieve it.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Goal: Progressive reformers sought to expand democracy and reduce corruption in politics by giving citizens more direct control over government.

Method: They advocated for direct primaries, which allowed voters rather than party bosses to choose candidates for office. They also pushed for initiatives and referendums (allowing citizens to propose and vote on laws) and the 17th Amendment (1913), which established direct election of U.S. senators. These reforms reduced the power of political machines and special interests."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE way the federal government's role changed during the New Deal AND ONE limitation of New Deal programs.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Change: The New Deal fundamentally expanded the federal government's role in the economy by establishing permanent programs to protect citizens from economic hardship, such as Social Security (1935), which provided pensions for the elderly and unemployment insurance, creating an ongoing federal safety net unprecedented in American history.

Limitation: New Deal programs often excluded African Americans and other minorities. Southern Democrats ensured that agricultural workers and domestic servants—occupations dominated by Black workers—were excluded from Social Security and minimum wage protections, perpetuating economic inequality despite the New Deal's broader goals."
