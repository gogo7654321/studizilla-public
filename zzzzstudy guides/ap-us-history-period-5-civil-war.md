## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE cause of the Civil War.**

*Sample Answer:*
"A major cause of the Civil War was the expansion of slavery into western territories. After the Mexican-American War, disputes over whether territories like Kansas would allow slavery intensified sectional conflict. The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which allowed popular sovereignty, led to violence in 'Bleeding Kansas' and destroyed the old party system, ultimately leading to the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, which prompted Southern secession."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE way that Reconstruction succeeded AND ONE way it failed.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Reconstruction succeeded in establishing constitutional protections for civil rights through the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery, guaranteed citizenship and due process, and protected voting rights regardless of race. These amendments provided the legal foundation for later civil rights advances.

Reconstruction failed to achieve lasting economic independence for freedpeople because it did not redistribute land. Most formerly enslaved people became sharecroppers, trapped in cycles of debt and economic dependence on the same landowners who had enslaved them, creating conditions that persisted for generations."

| War was about states' rights | States' rights TO slavery |
| Lincoln was an abolitionist | Initially wanted to stop expansion |
| Emancipation freed all slaves | Only in rebel states |
| Reconstruction was entirely failure | Amendments were major achievements |

### Analysis Errors

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Ignoring African American agency | Include Black perspectives |
| Oversimplifying causes | Multiple factors led to war |

| Missing continuities | Racism persisted before/after war |

## 📊 Evaluating Reconstruction

### The Debate

| View 1: Success | View 2: Failure |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ended slavery | Didn't end racism |
| Constitutional amendments | Not enforced |
| Black political participation | Temporary |
| Foundation laid | Took 100 years |

### Balanced View

Both—it achieved constitutional foundations but failed to protect rights or create economic justice. The amendments remained, enabling future progress.
