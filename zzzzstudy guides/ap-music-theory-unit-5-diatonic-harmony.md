# 🎹 Unit 5: Diatonic Harmony

## 📚 Unit Overview

Unit 5 expands harmonic understanding to seventh chords, common progressions, voice leading principles, and cadence types essential for the AP exam.

---

## 🎵 5.1 Seventh Chords

### Seventh Chord Structure

```
SEVENTH CHORD:
Triad + note a 7th above root
Four notes total

C MAJOR 7TH (CM7):
    B (7th)
    G (5th)
    E (3rd)
    C (Root)

Built: Root + 3rd + 5th + 7th
```

### Seventh Chord Qualities

```
FIVE COMMON SEVENTH CHORD TYPES:

MAJOR 7TH (M7, maj7, Δ7):
Major triad + Major 7th
C-E-G-B
Sound: Bright, jazzy

DOMINANT 7TH (7):
Major triad + minor 7th
C-E-G-B♭
Sound: Bluesy, needs resolution

MINOR 7TH (m7, -7):
Minor triad + minor 7th
C-E♭-G-B♭
Sound: Mellow, warm

HALF-DIMINISHED 7TH (ø7, m7♭5):
Diminished triad + minor 7th
C-E♭-G♭-B♭
Sound: Tense, jazzy

FULLY-DIMINISHED 7TH (°7, dim7):
Diminished triad + diminished 7th
C-E♭-G♭-B𝄫 (A)
Sound: Very tense, symmetrical
```

### Seventh Chord Interval Stacking

```
INTERVAL FORMULA (from root):

Type        3rd    5th    7th
Major 7     M3     P5     M7
Dominant 7  M3     P5     m7
Minor 7     m3     P5     m7
Half-dim 7  m3     d5     m7
Full-dim 7  m3     d5     d7

MEMORY AID - Stack of 3rds:
Maj7:     M3 + m3 + M3
Dom7:     M3 + m3 + m3
Min7:     m3 + M3 + m3
Half-dim: m3 + m3 + M3
Full-dim: m3 + m3 + m3
```

## 🔄 5.2 Seventh Chord Inversions

### Four Positions

```
SEVENTH CHORD INVERSIONS:

ROOT POSITION: Root in bass
    B
    G
    E    (C-E-G-B)
    C    7 or 7/5/3

FIRST INVERSION: 3rd in bass
    C
    B
    G    (E-G-B-C)
    E    6/5 or 6/5/3

SECOND INVERSION: 5th in bass
    E
    C
    B    (G-B-C-E)
    G    4/3 or 6/4/3

THIRD INVERSION: 7th in bass
    G
    E
    C    (B-C-E-G)
    B    4/2 or 6/4/2
```

### Figured Bass for Sevenths

```
FIGURED BASS SHORTHAND:

Root position:    7
First inversion:  6/5 (or just 65)
Second inversion: 4/3 (or just 43)
Third inversion:  4/2 (or just 42)

EXAMPLES:
V7 = Dominant 7th, root position
V65 = Dominant 7th, first inversion
V43 = Dominant 7th, second inversion
V42 = Dominant 7th, third inversion
```

## 🔀 5.4 Common Chord Progressions

### Basic Progression Patterns

```
COMMON PROGRESSIONS:

I - IV - V - I
(Tonic - Subdominant - Dominant - Tonic)
Most fundamental progression

I - V - vi - IV
(The "pop" progression)
Countless pop songs use this

ii - V - I
(Jazz foundation)
Most important jazz progression

I - vi - IV - V
(50s doo-wop)
Classic sound

vi - IV - I - V
(Emo/sad pop)
Starts on minor
```

### Progression Logic

```
FUNCTIONAL HARMONY:

TONIC (T): Rest, home
Chords: I, vi, iii

SUBDOMINANT (S): Away from home
Chords: IV, ii

DOMINANT (D): Tension, leads home
Chords: V, vii°

TYPICAL FLOW:
T → S → D → T
(Home → Away → Tension → Resolution)

VALID PROGRESSIONS:
T → D → T (skip subdominant)
T → S → T (skip dominant, weaker)
T → S → D → T (complete cycle)
```

### Root Movement

```
ROOT MOTION TENDENCIES:

STRONG PROGRESSIONS:
- Down a 5th (or up 4th): V → I, ii → V
- Down a 3rd: I → vi, IV → ii

WEAK/UNUSUAL:
- Up a 5th (or down 4th): I → V
- Up a 2nd: IV → V (common anyway)

CIRCLE OF FIFTHS PROGRESSION:
I → IV → vii° → iii → vi → ii → V → I
(All descending 5ths)
```

## 🎭 5.5 Cadences

### Authentic Cadences

```
PERFECT AUTHENTIC CADENCE (PAC):
V → I (or V7 → I)
- Both chords in root position
- Soprano ends on tonic (scale degree 1)
- Strongest sense of finality

IMPERFECT AUTHENTIC CADENCE (IAC):
V → I
- One or both inverted, OR
- Soprano ends on 3rd or 5th
- Less conclusive

Examples (C major):
PAC: G-B-D → C-E-G (soprano G→C)
IAC: G-B-D → E-G-C (soprano B→E)
```

### Half Cadence

```
HALF CADENCE (HC):
Any chord → V
(Ends on dominant)

Like a musical "comma"
Creates expectation

Common approach chords:
I → V
ii → V
IV → V
vi → V

PHRYGIAN HALF CADENCE:
iv6 → V in minor
(♭6 in bass moves to 5)
Spanish/dramatic sound
```

### Plagal and Deceptive Cadences

```
PLAGAL CADENCE:
IV → I
"Amen" cadence
Softer conclusion than authentic

DECEPTIVE CADENCE (DC):
V → vi (instead of I)
"Deceptive" because we expect I
Prolongs the phrase
Creates surprise

In minor: V → VI
(G major → F major in A minor)
```

### Cadence Summary

```
CADENCE TYPES:

Name      Formula    Effect
PAC       V→I        Full stop
IAC       V→I        Softer stop
HC        ?→V        Comma, pause
Plagal    IV→I       Amen ending
Deceptive V→vi       Surprise

IDENTIFYING CADENCES:
1. Find phrase endings
2. Check last two chords
3. Check bass motion
4. Check soprano line
```

## 🎵 5.6 Voice Leading Basics

### Four-Part Writing

```
SATB VOICING:
Soprano (S): Highest voice
Alto (A): Second highest  
Tenor (T): Second lowest
Bass (B): Lowest voice

RANGES:
Soprano: C4 - G5
Alto: G3 - D5
Tenor: C3 - G4
Bass: E2 - C4

SPACING:
S-A: No more than octave
A-T: No more than octave
T-B: Can be larger
No voice crossing!
```

### Voice Leading Principles

```
SMOOTH VOICE LEADING:

1. COMMON TONES
   Keep notes shared between chords
   
2. STEPWISE MOTION
   Move other voices by step
   
3. CONTRARY MOTION
   Opposite direction to bass
   
4. AVOID LEAPS
   Large leaps less smooth
   (Leaps of 4th or less preferred)

EXAMPLE: C → F
C-E-G-C → C-F-A-C
C stays (common tone)
E moves to F (step)
G moves to A (step)
C stays (common tone)
```

### Voice Leading Errors

```
ERRORS TO AVOID:

PARALLEL 5THS:
Two voices moving in P5 → P5
C-G → D-A (both move up step)
FORBIDDEN in common practice

PARALLEL OCTAVES:
Two voices moving in P8 → P8
C-C → D-D (both voices same motion)
FORBIDDEN

DIRECT/HIDDEN 5THS/8VES:
Similar motion into P5 or P8
Outer voices arriving together
AVOID between soprano and bass

VOICE CROSSING:
Alto below tenor, etc.
AVOID
```

## ⚡ 5.7 Dominant Function Chords

### The Dominant Seventh

```
V7 (Dominant Seventh):
Most important seventh chord!

STRUCTURE:
Major triad + minor 7th
Contains tritone (4 → 7)

RESOLUTION:
7th (4) → 3 (step down)
Leading tone (7) → 1 (step up)
5 → 1 (bass)

C MAJOR V7 → I:
G-B-D-F → C-C-E-G
F resolves down to E
B resolves up to C
```

### Leading Tone Seventh Chords

```
vii° AND vii°7:

HALF-DIMINISHED (viiø7):
In major keys
B-D-F-A (in C major)

FULLY-DIMINISHED (vii°7):
In minor keys (from harmonic minor)
G♯-B-D-F (in A minor)

RESOLUTION:
- Leading tone → Tonic
- 7th → down by step
- Chord resolves to I (or i)

vii° often substitutes for V7
(Same leading tone, similar function)
```

## 📊 5.8 Harmonic Analysis

### Roman Numeral Analysis

```
ANALYSIS STEPS:

1. IDENTIFY KEY
   Look at key signature
   Check for accidentals
   
2. IDENTIFY BASS NOTE
   Determine scale degree
   
3. IDENTIFY CHORD QUALITY
   Major, minor, diminished?
   
4. DETERMINE INVERSION
   What's in the bass?
   
5. WRITE ROMAN NUMERAL
   With inversion figures

EXAMPLE (C major):
Bass: E, Chord: E-G-C
E = scale degree 3
Chord = C major (root C)
Inversion = 1st (3rd in bass)
Symbol: I6
```

### Non-Chord Tones (Preview)

```
EMBELLISHING TONES:

PASSING TONE (PT):
Fills gap by step
C → D → E (D is PT)

NEIGHBOR TONE (NT):
Step away and back
C → D → C (D is NT)

SUSPENSION (SUS):
Held over, resolves down
Tied note that resolves

ANTICIPATION (ANT):
Arrives early
Note of next chord

(More detail in Unit 6)

   - Contains tritone

2. PROGRESSIONS FOLLOW PATTERNS
   - T → S → D → T logic
   - Circle of fifths motion
   - Strong root movement

3. CADENCES PUNCTUATE PHRASES
   - PAC = full stop
   - HC = comma
   - DC = surprise

4. VOICE LEADING REQUIRES CARE
   - Common tones hold
   - Stepwise motion
   - Avoid parallels

5. V7 → I IS ESSENTIAL
   - Tritone resolution
   - 7→1, 4→3
   - Strongest progression
```

---

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
CADENCE IDENTIFICATION:

1. FIND PHRASE ENDING
   (Usually at fermata or rest)

2. CHECK LAST TWO CHORDS
   V → I = Authentic
   ? → V = Half
   V → vi = Deceptive
   IV → I = Plagal

3. FOR PAC VS. IAC
   Root position both chords?
   Soprano on tonic?
   If yes to both = PAC

VOICE LEADING CHECK:
Circle all 5ths and octaves
Check if parallel (same direction)
If parallel = ERROR
```
