mobiles et novis plerumque rebus student."
"The Gauls are fickle in making decisions 
and generally eager for revolution."

4. SERVE POLITICAL PURPOSES
   Caesar: immediate political career
   Vergil: Augustan ideology

DIFFERENCES:

CAESAR:
- Clear us/them distinction
- Less sympathetic to enemies
- Practical, strategic view

VERGIL:
- Enemies are sympathetic
- Tragedy in their defeat
- Moral complexity
- What Rome costs others
```
