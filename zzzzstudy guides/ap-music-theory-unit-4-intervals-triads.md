# 🎸 Unit 4: Intervals and Triads

## 📚 Unit Overview

Unit 4 builds harmonic vocabulary through intervals (two-note combinations) and triads (three-note chords), essential for understanding harmony.

## 🎵 4.1 Interval Basics

### Interval Definition

```
INTERVAL:
Distance between two pitches

MELODIC INTERVAL:
Notes played in succession
(One after another)

HARMONIC INTERVAL:
Notes played simultaneously
(At the same time)

NAMING INTERVALS:
Quantity (number) + Quality (type)
Example: Major 3rd, Perfect 5th
```

### Interval Quantity (Number)

```
COUNTING INTERVAL SIZE:

Include both starting and ending notes!

C to D = 2nd (C-D: count 1-2)
C to E = 3rd (C-D-E: count 1-2-3)
C to F = 4th (C-D-E-F: count 1-2-3-4)
C to G = 5th
C to A = 6th
C to B = 7th
C to C = Octave (8th)

UNISON: Same pitch = 1st (or unison)
```

### Simple vs. Compound Intervals

```
SIMPLE INTERVALS:
Octave or smaller (1-8)

COMPOUND INTERVALS:
Larger than an octave

9th = Octave + 2nd
10th = Octave + 3rd
11th = Octave + 4th
12th = Octave + 5th

To reduce compound to simple:
Subtract 7 (or bring down an octave)
9th - 7 = 2nd
```

---

## 🔍 4.2 Interval Quality

### Perfect Intervals

```
PERFECT INTERVALS:
1 (unison), 4, 5, 8 (octave)

These intervals are "perfect" in major scale:

C to C = Perfect unison (P1)
C to F = Perfect 4th (P4)
C to G = Perfect 5th (P5)
C to C = Perfect 8th (P8)

WHY "PERFECT"?
- Most consonant
- Same in major AND minor
- Frequency ratios are simple
```

### Major and Minor Intervals

```
MAJOR INTERVALS:
2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th in major scale

C to D = Major 2nd (M2)
C to E = Major 3rd (M3)
C to A = Major 6th (M6)
C to B = Major 7th (M7)

MINOR INTERVALS:
One half step smaller than major

C to D♭ = minor 2nd (m2)
C to E♭ = minor 3rd (m3)
C to A♭ = minor 6th (m6)
C to B♭ = minor 7th (m7)
```

### Augmented and Diminished

```
AUGMENTED (+):
One half step LARGER than perfect or major

P5 (C-G) + half step = A5 (C-G♯)
M3 (C-E) + half step = A3 (C-E♯)

DIMINISHED (°):
One half step SMALLER than perfect or minor

P5 (C-G) - half step = d5 (C-G♭)
m3 (C-E♭) - half step = d3 (C-E𝄫)

TRITONE:
A4 = d5 (same sound, 3 whole steps)
C-F♯ = A4
C-G♭ = d5
```

### Interval Quality Summary

```
INTERVAL QUALITY CHART:

     d    m    P    M    A
     ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
1:   d1   -    P1   -    A1
2:   d2   m2   -    M2   A2
3:   d3   m3   -    M3   A3
4:   d4   -    P4   -    A4
5:   d5   -    P5   -    A5
6:   d6   m6   -    M6   A6
7:   d7   m7   -    M7   A7
8:   d8   -    P8   -    A8

Perfect intervals: 1, 4, 5, 8
Non-perfect: 2, 3, 6, 7
```

---

## 📏 4.3 Interval Identification Methods

### Half-Step Counting Method

```
COUNT HALF STEPS:

m2 = 1 half step    (C-D♭)
M2 = 2 half steps   (C-D)
m3 = 3 half steps   (C-E♭)
M3 = 4 half steps   (C-E)
P4 = 5 half steps   (C-F)
A4/d5 = 6 half steps (tritone)
P5 = 7 half steps   (C-G)
m6 = 8 half steps   (C-A♭)
M6 = 9 half steps   (C-A)
m7 = 10 half steps  (C-B♭)
M7 = 11 half steps  (C-B)
P8 = 12 half steps  (C-C)
```

### Major Scale Method

```
USING MAJOR SCALE OF BOTTOM NOTE:

1. Build major scale from bottom note
2. Find top note in that scale
3. If IN scale: M2, M3, P4, P5, M6, M7
4. If not in scale: adjust quality

EXAMPLE: E to C
E major scale: E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D♯
C is NOT in E major (C♯ is)
C is one half step LOWER than C♯
M6 lowered by half step = m6

E to C = minor 6th
```

### White Key Intervals

```
WHITE KEY REFERENCE:

All P1, P4, P5, P8 are PERFECT except:
- B to F = d5 (or F to B = A4)

All 2nds are MAJOR except:
- E-F and B-C = m2

All 3rds are MAJOR:
- C-E, F-A, G-B
Or MINOR:
- D-F, E-G, A-C, B-D

Memorize the exceptions!
```

---

## 🔄 4.4 Interval Inversion

### Inversion Concept

```
INTERVAL INVERSION:
Move the bottom note up an octave
(Or top note down an octave)

C-E (3rd) inverted = E-C (6th)

ORIGINAL     INVERTED
┌────────────────────┐
│ E                  │
│ C      becomes   E │
└────────────────────┘
              C (up octave)
```

### Inversion Rules

```
QUANTITY INVERSION:
Interval + Inversion = 9

2nd ↔ 7th  (2+7=9)
3rd ↔ 6th  (3+6=9)
4th ↔ 5th  (4+5=9)
Unison ↔ Octave (1+8=9)

QUALITY INVERSION:
Major ↔ minor
Perfect ↔ Perfect
Augmented ↔ diminished

EXAMPLES:
M3 inverts to m6
P4 inverts to P5
A5 inverts to d4
m2 inverts to M7
```

### Using Inversion for Identification

```
INVERSION SHORTCUT:

If interval is large, invert it!

C to B = ? (large interval)
Invert: B to C = m2 (easy to hear)
m2 inverts to M7
Therefore: C to B = M7

Smaller intervals are easier to identify
```

## 🎼 4.5 Consonance and Dissonance

### Consonant Intervals

```
PERFECT CONSONANCES:
Most stable
- Perfect unison (P1)
- Perfect octave (P8)
- Perfect 5th (P5)

IMPERFECT CONSONANCES:
Pleasant but less stable
- Major 3rd (M3)
- minor 3rd (m3)
- Major 6th (M6)
- minor 6th (m6)
```

### Dissonant Intervals

```
DISSONANT INTERVALS:
Create tension, need resolution

MILD DISSONANCE:
- Perfect 4th (in certain contexts)
- Major 2nd (M2)
- minor 7th (m7)

STRONG DISSONANCE:
- minor 2nd (m2)
- Major 7th (M7)
- Tritone (A4/d5)

NOTE: P4 is contextual!
Consonant in chords
Dissonant against bass
```

## 🎹 4.6 Triad Construction

### Triad Definition

```
TRIAD:
Three-note chord built in 3rds

ROOT: Bottom note (names the chord)
THIRD: Note a 3rd above root
FIFTH: Note a 5th above root

C MAJOR TRIAD:
    ● E (5th)
    ● G (3rd)
    ● C (Root)
    
Written: C-E-G
```

### Triad Qualities

```
FOUR TRIAD QUALITIES:

MAJOR (M):
Root + M3 + P5
C-E-G (C major)

MINOR (m):
Root + m3 + P5
C-E♭-G (C minor)

DIMINISHED (°):
Root + m3 + d5
C-E♭-G♭ (C diminished)

AUGMENTED (+):
Root + M3 + A5
C-E-G♯ (C augmented)
```

### Triad Quality Formulas

```
INTERVAL STACKING:

         3rd  +  3rd  =  5th
Major:   M3   +  m3   =  P5
minor:   m3   +  M3   =  P5
dim:     m3   +  m3   =  d5
Aug:     M3   +  M3   =  A5

MEMORY AID:
Major: "big-small" (M3+m3)
minor: "small-big" (m3+M3)
dim: "small-small" (m3+m3)
Aug: "big-big" (M3+M3)
```

### Building Triads

```
BUILDING ANY TRIAD:

E♭ MAJOR:
1. Root: E♭
2. M3 above: G (E♭-F-G, 4 half steps)
3. P5 above root: B♭ (7 half steps)
Result: E♭-G-B♭

F♯ MINOR:
1. Root: F♯
2. m3 above: A (3 half steps)
3. P5 above root: C♯ (7 half steps)
Result: F♯-A-C♯
```

---

## 🔄 4.7 Triad Inversions

### Root Position and Inversions

```
TRIAD POSITIONS:

ROOT POSITION: Root on bottom
    G
    E
    C     (C-E-G, C major)

FIRST INVERSION: 3rd on bottom
    C
    G
    E     (E-G-C)

SECOND INVERSION: 5th on bottom
    E
    C
    G     (G-C-E)
```

### Figured Bass Notation

```
FIGURED BASS SYMBOLS:

ROOT POSITION: 5/3 (or just chord letter)
    C or C5/3

FIRST INVERSION: 6/3 (or just 6)
    C6 or C6/3

SECOND INVERSION: 6/4
    C6/4

EXAMPLE:
C (root position)
C6 (E in bass)
C6/4 (G in bass)
```

### Identifying Inversions

```
FINDING THE ROOT:

Method: Rearrange to stacked 3rds

Given: E-G-C
Rearrange: C-E-G (3rd-3rd)
Root = C (bottom of stacked thirds)
Inversion = 1st (E was in bass)

Given: G-C-E
Rearrange: C-E-G
Root = C
Inversion = 2nd (G was in bass)
```

## 🎵 4.8 Triads in Keys

### Diatonic Triads in Major

```
MAJOR KEY DIATONIC TRIADS:

Scale degree:  I   ii   iii   IV   V   vi   vii°
Quality:       M   m    m     M    M   m    dim

C MAJOR:
I   = C major   (C-E-G)
ii  = D minor   (D-F-A)
iii = E minor   (E-G-B)
IV  = F major   (F-A-C)
V   = G major   (G-B-D)
vi  = A minor   (A-C-E)
vii°= B dim     (B-D-F)

Pattern: M m m M M m dim
```

### Diatonic Triads in Minor

```
MINOR KEY DIATONIC TRIADS (Natural):

Scale degree:  i   ii°  III  iv   v   VI  VII
Quality:       m   dim  M    m    m   M   M

A MINOR (natural):
i   = A minor   (A-C-E)
ii° = B dim     (B-D-F)
III = C major   (C-E-G)
iv  = D minor   (D-F-A)
v   = E minor   (E-G-B)
VI  = F major   (F-A-C)
VII = G major   (G-B-D)

WITH HARMONIC MINOR (raised 7th):
V becomes MAJOR: E-G♯-B
vii° becomes DIMINISHED: G♯-B-D
```

### Roman Numeral Analysis

```
ROMAN NUMERAL CONVENTIONS:

UPPERCASE = Major triad
lowercase = minor triad
° = diminished
+ = augmented

EXAMPLES:
I = Major tonic
i = minor tonic
V = Major dominant (in minor: from harmonic)
ii° = diminished supertonic
vii° = diminished leading tone
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

```
1. INTERVALS HAVE TWO PARTS
   - Quantity (number)
   - Quality (type)
   - Both required for full ID

2. PERFECT INTERVALS ARE SPECIAL
   - Unison, 4th, 5th, octave
   - Can be P, A, or d
   - Not major or minor

3. INVERSION FLIPS QUALITY
   - Major ↔ minor
   - Augmented ↔ diminished
   - Perfect stays perfect

4. TRIADS BUILD ON THIRDS
   - Stacked 3rds from root
   - Four qualities (M, m, dim, Aug)
   - Three inversions possible

5. DIATONIC TRIADS FOLLOW PATTERN
   - Major: M m m M M m dim
   - Minor: m dim M m m M M
   - Roman numerals show function
```

---

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
QUICK INTERVAL ID:

1. COUNT THE LETTER NAMES
   C to G = 5 letters = 5th

2. CHECK IF IN MAJOR SCALE
   Is G in C major? Yes = P5

3. ADJUST IF NEEDED
   G♭ in C major? No, flat = d5

TRIAD QUALITY:

1. IDENTIFY THE 5TH FIRST
   Perfect, dim, or augmented?

2. THEN CHECK THE 3RD
   Major or minor?

3. COMBINE:
   P5 + M3 = Major
   P5 + m3 = minor
   d5 + m3 = dim
   A5 + M3 = Aug
```
