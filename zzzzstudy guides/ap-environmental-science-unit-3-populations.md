## 📈 Human Population Growth

### Historical Growth

| Period | Population | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **10,000 BCE** | ~5 million | Hunter-gatherers |
| **1 CE** | ~300 million | Agricultural societies |

### Growth Rate

| Formula | |
|---------|--|
| **Growth rate (%)** | = (CBR - CDR) / 10 |
| **Or** | = (Births - Deaths) / Population × 100 |

### Doubling Time

| Rule of 70 | |
|------------|--|
| **Doubling time** | = 70 / Growth rate (%) |
| **Example** | 2% growth = 35 years to double |

## 📝 Free Response Question Practice

### FRQ Practice 1: Population Calculations

**Scenario:** A country has the following data:
- Population: 50 million
- Births: 1.5 million/year
- Deaths: 0.5 million/year

**(a)** Calculate the crude birth rate, crude death rate, and natural increase rate. (4 points)

### Sample Answer Rubric:

| Part | Key Points |
|------|------------|
| **(a)** | CBR = (1.5M/50M) × 1000 = **30**; CDR = (0.5M/50M) × 1000 = **10**; NIR = 30-10 = **20 per 1000** = 2% |
| **(b)** | Doubling time = 70/2 = **35 years** |
| **(c)** | Stage 2 (transitional); high birth rate, declining death rate |
| **(d)** | Base would narrow as birth rate falls; bulge would move upward as population ages |

### FRQ Practice 2: Demographic Transition

## 🧮 Calculation Practice

### Rate Calculations

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Pop = 25M, Births = 750,000. Find CBR. | (750,000/25,000,000) × 1000 = **30** |
| Pop = 40M, Deaths = 400,000. Find CDR. | (400,000/40,000,000) × 1000 = **10** |
| CBR = 35, CDR = 10. Find growth rate. | (35-10)/10 = **2.5%** |
| Growth rate = 1.4%. Find doubling time. | 70/1.4 = **50 years** |

### Demographic Transition Practice

| Stage | CBR | CDR | Growth Rate | Example |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 40 | 38 | **0.2%** | Pre-industrial |
| 2 | 42 | 15 | **2.7%** | Kenya, 1980 |
| 3 | 25 | 8 | **1.7%** | Brazil today |
| 4 | 12 | 11 | **0.1%** | USA today |
| 5 | 9 | 12 | **-0.3%** | Japan today |

### IPAT Calculations

| Country | P (millions) | A ($ per capita) | T (emissions per $) | I (total emissions) |
|---------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| A | 300 | 60,000 | 0.0003 | **5,400 Mt** |
| B | 1,400 | 10,000 | 0.0005 | **7,000 Mt** |

| **All developing = Stage 2** | Many in Stage 3 |
| **CDR always decreases** | Can increase in Stage 5 |
| **Birth rate falls first** | Death rate falls first |

### Test-Taking Tips

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Show all calculations** | Partial credit available |

| **Identify DTM stages** | Match rates to stages |
| **Connect to environment** | Use IPAT equation |

**Good luck on your AP Environmental Science exam! 🍀🌍👥**

Remember: The demographic transition explains why death rates fall before birth rates. Population momentum means growth continues even after TFR drops to replacement level!
