(A) Military conquest by Arab armies
(B) Merchant activity and Sufi missionaries
(C) Forced conversion by local rulers

## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Question (SAQ)

**Question**: Answer parts a, b, and c.

a) Identify ONE way that the Indian Ocean trade network facilitated cultural exchange between 1200 and 1450.

b) Identify ONE way that the Silk Road facilitated cultural exchange between 1200 and 1450.

c) Explain ONE significant difference between how ideas spread along the Indian Ocean trade routes versus the Silk Road.

**Sample Answer**:

a) The Indian Ocean trade network facilitated cultural exchange through the spread of Islam from Arabia to East Africa and Southeast Asia. Muslim merchants established trading communities in port cities like Kilwa and Malacca, where they intermarried with locals and spread their religious practices, creating syncretic cultures like the Swahili civilization.

b) The Silk Road facilitated cultural exchange through the transmission of technologies like paper, gunpowder, and the compass from China to the Islamic world and eventually Europe. These innovations traveled along with trade goods, carried by merchants who stopped at caravanserais where they exchanged knowledge.

c) A significant difference was the speed and volume of exchange. Indian Ocean maritime trade was faster and could carry more goods, leading to larger diasporic communities and more rapid cultural integration. The Silk Road's overland routes were slower and more dangerous, making cultural exchange more gradual and often carried by intermediaries rather than direct contact between distant cultures.

---

## ✍️ Sample DBQ Approach

**Prompt**: Evaluate the extent to which trade networks affected the development of states and empires from 1200 to 1450.

### Planning Your Response

| Paragraph | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **Thesis** | Trade networks significantly shaped state development through wealth accumulation, cultural legitimacy, and urban growth |
| **Body 1** | West Africa - Mali grew wealthy from trans-Saharan trade |
| **Body 2** | Swahili city-states - Indian Ocean trade created independent cities |
| **Body 3** | Song China - Maritime trade increased government revenue |
| **Complexity** | But some states (Aztec, Inca) developed with limited external trade |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Assuming all regions connected | Americas largely isolated |
| Oversimplifying Islam's spread | Multiple methods: trade, conquest, missionaries |
| Ignoring regional variations | Each area had unique characteristics |
| Confusing cause and effect | Trade enabled states, states protected trade |
