## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE way the French and Indian War contributed to the American Revolution.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The French and Indian War contributed to the American Revolution by leaving Britain with massive war debt that led Parliament to impose new taxes on the colonies, such as the Stamp Act (1765). Colonists resisted these taxes with the argument of 'no taxation without representation,' beginning a cycle of British policies and colonial resistance that escalated to revolution."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE continuity AND ONE change in the concept of liberty between the colonial period and the early republic (1790s).**

*Sample Answer:*
"A continuity was the commitment to representative government: colonists demanded representation in any body that taxed them, and the Constitution established a republic with elected representatives. A change was the expansion of who could participate: while colonial assemblies often required substantial property ownership to vote, many states reduced property requirements during and after the Revolution, broadening (though not universalizing) political participation."
