## 📚 Unit 1: Research Methods Review

### Inquiry Questions

```
QUESTION DEVELOPMENT:

GOOD QUESTIONS ARE:
□ Complex (not yes/no)
□ Researchable (sources exist)
□ Debatable (multiple views)
□ Significant (matters)
□ Focused (manageable scope)

PROGRESSION:
Factual → Analytical → Evaluative

EXAMPLE:
Weak: "Is social media bad?"
Strong: "To what extent should schools 
regulate student social media use 
to balance safety with free expression?"
```

### Source Evaluation

```
SIFT METHOD:

S - STOP
    Pause and consider source
    
I - INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE
    Who created it? Why?
    
F - FIND BETTER COVERAGE
    What do other sources say?
    
T - TRACE CLAIMS
    Where does info originate?

SOURCE TYPES:
- Scholarly (peer-reviewed)
- Professional (trade, government)
- Popular (news, magazines)
- Primary (original documents)
- Secondary (analysis)
```

### Evidence Evaluation

```
EVIDENCE CRITERIA:

RELEVANCE:
Does it address your question?

RELIABILITY:
Is the source trustworthy?

SUFFICIENCY:
Is there enough evidence?

CURRENCY:
Is it recent enough?

BIAS AWARENESS:
What perspective is represented?
```

## 📊 Unit 2: Argument and Evidence Review

### Argument Structure

```
ARGUMENT COMPONENTS:

       ┌──────────────┐
       │    CLAIM     │
       │   (Thesis)   │
       └──────┬───────┘
              │
    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
    ▼                   ▼
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│ EVIDENCE │      │ EVIDENCE │
└────┬─────┘      └────┬─────┘
     │                 │
     ▼                 ▼
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│REASONING │      │REASONING │
│(Warrant) │      │(Warrant) │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘
```

### Thesis Statements

```
STRONG THESIS CHARACTERISTICS:

ARGUABLE: Can be debated
SPECIFIC: Clear about position
COMPLEX: Acknowledges nuance
SUPPORTABLE: Evidence exists

EXAMPLE:
Weak: "Climate change is a problem."
Strong: "While technological solutions 
offer promise, addressing climate change 
requires policy interventions that 
balance economic stability with 
environmental sustainability."
```

### Evidence Integration

```
EVIDENCE SANDWICH:

1. INTRODUCE
   Set context
   "According to Smith (2023)..."

2. PRESENT
   Quote or paraphrase
   "...studies show that..." (p. 45).

3. ANALYZE
   Explain significance
   "This demonstrates that..."

SIGNAL PHRASES:
- According to [Author]...
- [Author] argues that...
- Research indicates...
- Evidence suggests...
```

### Logical Fallacies

```
FALLACIES TO AVOID:

AD HOMINEM: Attack person, not argument
STRAW MAN: Misrepresent opposition
FALSE DICHOTOMY: Only two options
SLIPPERY SLOPE: Unfounded chain
HASTY GENERALIZATION: Too few examples
CIRCULAR REASONING: Conclusion in premise
RED HERRING: Irrelevant distraction
FALSE CAUSE: Correlation ≠ causation
```

### Counterarguments

```
HANDLING OPPOSITION:

1. INTRODUCE FAIRLY
   "Critics argue that..."

2. PRESENT ACCURATELY
   Don't strawman

3. RESPOND
   "However, this overlooks..."

4. RETURN TO ARGUMENT
   "Therefore, my position..."

STRATEGIES:
- Concede and rebut
- Reframe
- Qualify
- Embrace complexity
```

### Synthesis

```
SYNTHESIS APPROACHES:

FIND AGREEMENT:
"Both Smith and Jones argue..."

FIND TENSION:
"While Smith claims X, Jones contends..."

FIND GAPS:
"None address..."

FIND PATTERNS:
"A common theme emerges..."

NOT SUMMARY:
Sources in conversation
New understanding created
```
