## 🧮 Key Formulas Summary

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| $\text{Opportunity Cost} = \frac{\text{What you give up}}{\text{What you get}}$ | Trade-off calculation |
| $\text{OC of Good X} = \frac{\text{Max Y}}{\text{Max X}}$ | From PPC endpoints |
| $\text{Slope of PPC} = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$ | Opportunity cost at a point |
| $\text{Real GDP Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{GDP}_2 - \text{GDP}_1}{\text{GDP}_1} \times 100$ | Measuring growth |

---

## 📊 Comparative Advantage Calculation

### Step-by-Step Method

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Find maximum output for each country/person |
| **2** | Calculate opportunity cost for each good |
| **3** | Compare OC—lower OC = comparative advantage |
| **4** | Each should specialize in lower OC good |
| **5** | Terms of trade: between the two OCs |

### Example Problem

| Country | Max Wheat | Max Cloth |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **USA** | 100 | 50 |
| **UK** | 60 | 40 |

| Country | OC of 1 Wheat | OC of 1 Cloth |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **USA** | 50/100 = 0.5 Cloth | 100/50 = 2 Wheat |
| **UK** | 40/60 = 0.67 Cloth | 60/40 = 1.5 Wheat |

**Result:** USA has CA in Wheat (0.5 < 0.67), UK has CA in Cloth (1.5 < 2)

**Terms of Trade:** 1 Wheat should trade for between 0.5 and 0.67 Cloth

## 🎓 FRQ Practice

### Sample Free Response Question

**Question:** Country A can produce 100 units of food or 50 units of clothing. Country B can produce 80 units of food or 40 units of clothing.

**(a)** Which country has an absolute advantage in food? In clothing?

**(b)** Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of food for each country.

**(c)** Which country has a comparative advantage in food? Explain.

**(d)** If the countries specialize and trade, what would be an acceptable terms of trade for 1 unit of food?

### Model Answer

**(a)** Country A has absolute advantage in BOTH goods (100 > 80 for food; 50 > 40 for clothing)

**(b)** 
- Country A: OC of 1 food = 50/100 = **0.5 clothing**
- Country B: OC of 1 food = 40/80 = **0.5 clothing**

**(c)** Neither has comparative advantage in food—OC is equal (0.5 = 0.5). When opportunity costs are equal, there are no gains from trade in this model.

**(d)** No mutually beneficial terms exist since opportunity costs are identical.

## 🎯 Quick Reference Card

### The Three Economic Questions
1. **WHAT** to produce?
2. **HOW** to produce?
3. **FOR WHOM** to produce?

### Four Factors of Production (and Payments)
| Factor | Payment |
|--------|---------|
| Land → | Rent |
| Labor → | Wages |
| Capital → | Interest |
| Entrepreneurship → | Profit |

### PPC Quick Guide
| Point Location | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| ON the curve | Efficient |
| INSIDE the curve | Unemployed resources |
| OUTSIDE the curve | Currently impossible |
| Curve shifts OUT | Economic growth |

### Macro Goals (The Big Three)
1. 📈 **Economic Growth** (Real GDP ↑)
2. 💼 **Full Employment** (Low unemployment)
3. 💵 **Price Stability** (Low, stable inflation)

**Good luck on your AP Macroeconomics exam! 🍀📊**

Remember: Scarcity forces choices, opportunity cost measures trade-offs, and macro policy aims to achieve growth, full employment, and price stability!
