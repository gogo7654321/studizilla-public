## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE cause of the Civil Rights Movement's success AND ONE reason for its limitations.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Success: The Civil Rights Movement succeeded in part because of strategic use of media. Events like the Birmingham campaign (1963), where Bull Connor's police used fire hoses and dogs on peaceful protesters including children, were broadcast on national television, shocking white Americans and building support for civil rights legislation including the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Limitation: The movement was limited in addressing economic inequality and de facto segregation in Northern cities. When Martin Luther King Jr. moved his campaign to Chicago in 1966 to address housing discrimination, he faced less success because racial inequality in the North was embedded in economic structures and residential patterns rather than explicit laws, making it harder to target and change."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE way the Cold War affected American domestic policy.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The Cold War led to significant expansion of federal spending on education and science after the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957. The National Defense Education Act (1958) provided federal funding for science, mathematics, and foreign language education to compete with the Soviets technologically. This represented a major expansion of federal involvement in education, justified by national security needs rather than traditional educational arguments."
