## 📡 CELL COMMUNICATION OVERVIEW

### WHY CELLS COMMUNICATE

**Cells must coordinate activities:**
- 🧬 Development (differentiation, growth)
- 🛡️ Immune responses
- ⚡ Nerve impulses
- 🔄 Metabolism regulation
- 🚫 Apoptosis (programmed cell death)

**Single-celled organisms:** Respond to environment
**Multicellular organisms:** Coordinate millions of cells!

### THREE STAGES OF CELL SIGNALING

**1. Reception:**
- Signal molecule (ligand) binds receptor
- Changes receptor shape

**2. Transduction:**
- Signal relayed through series of molecules
- Often amplified

**3. Response:**
- Cellular activity changes
- Gene expression, enzyme activity, etc.

## 📶 TYPES OF CELL SIGNALING

### SIGNALING BASED ON DISTANCE

| Type | Distance | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Direct contact** | Adjacent cells | Gap junctions, cell-cell recognition |
| **Paracrine** | Nearby cells | Growth factors, neurotransmitters |
| **Synaptic** | Across synapse | Neurotransmitters (specialized paracrine) |
| **Endocrine** | Distant cells (via blood) | Hormones |
| **Autocrine** | Same cell | Growth factors in development |

### DIRECT CONTACT SIGNALING

**Cell-cell recognition:**
- Membrane proteins interact directly
- Important in immune system
- Example: T-cell recognizing antigen on infected cell

**Gap junctions (animals):**
- Channels between adjacent cells
- Allow ions, small molecules to pass
- Coordinate heart muscle contractions

**Plasmodesmata (plants):**
- Channels through cell walls
- Connect cytoplasm of adjacent cells

### PARACRINE SIGNALING

**Local signaling** - short range

**Signal molecule:**
- Secreted by signaling cell
- Diffuses to nearby target cells
- Quickly degraded (local effect)

**Examples:**
- 🧠 Neurotransmitters at synapse
- 🩹 Growth factors in wound healing
- 🔥 Cytokines in inflammation

### ENDOCRINE SIGNALING

**Long-distance signaling** via bloodstream

**Hormones:**
- Secreted by endocrine glands
- Travel through blood
- Affect distant target cells

**Examples:**
- 📈 Insulin (pancreas → body cells)
- 🦋 Thyroid hormone (thyroid → many tissues)
- 💪 Epinephrine (adrenal → heart, muscles)

**Slower but longer-lasting** than paracrine

---

## 🔑 SIGNAL RECEPTION

### LIGAND-RECEPTOR BINDING

**Ligand**: Signaling molecule (hormone, neurotransmitter, etc.)
**Receptor**: Protein that recognizes specific ligand

**Properties:**
- Highly specific (lock and key)
- Reversible binding
- Induces conformational change
- Triggers cellular response

### RECEPTOR LOCATION DEPENDS ON LIGAND

| Ligand Type | Properties | Receptor Location |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Hydrophilic** | Cannot cross membrane | Plasma membrane |
| **Hydrophobic** | Can cross membrane | Cytoplasm or nucleus |

**Hydrophilic ligands:**
- Peptide hormones (insulin, glucagon)
- Neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine)
- Growth factors

**Hydrophobic ligands:**
- Steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisol)
- Thyroid hormone
- Nitric oxide (NO)

### MEMBRANE RECEPTORS

**Three main types:**

**1. G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs):**
- Largest family of receptors
- 7 transmembrane domains
- Activate G proteins when ligand binds
- Examples: Epinephrine, many neurotransmitters

**2. Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs):**
- Dimerize when ligand binds
- Autophosphorylate (add phosphate to themselves)
- Activate multiple pathways
- Examples: Insulin, growth factors

**3. Ion Channel Receptors (Ligand-gated):**
- Open/close in response to ligand
- Allow ions to flow
- Very fast response
- Examples: Acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction

### INTRACELLULAR RECEPTORS

**For hydrophobic signals:**
- Located in cytoplasm or nucleus
- Ligand diffuses through membrane
- Hormone-receptor complex acts as transcription factor
- Directly affects gene expression

**Example: Steroid hormones**
1. Steroid crosses membrane
2. Binds receptor in cytoplasm
3. Complex enters nucleus
4. Binds DNA, activates genes
5. mRNA → protein

**Response is slow but long-lasting** (changes gene expression)

---

## ⚡ SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION

### OVERVIEW

**Transduction**: Converting signal to cellular response

**Key features:**
- Multiple steps (relay molecules)
- Signal amplification
- Specificity of response
- Can be regulated at each step

### PHOSPHORYLATION CASCADE

**Most common transduction mechanism:**

**Kinase**: Enzyme that adds phosphate (from ATP)
**Phosphatase**: Enzyme that removes phosphate

**Cascade:**
```
Receptor activated
      ↓
Kinase 1 activated → phosphorylates Kinase 2
      ↓
Kinase 2 activated → phosphorylates Kinase 3
      ↓
Kinase 3 activated → phosphorylates target protein
      ↓
CELLULAR RESPONSE
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Amplification at each step
- ✅ Multiple regulation points
- ✅ Can branch to multiple responses
- ✅ Quickly reversible (phosphatases)

### G-PROTEIN SIGNALING PATHWAY

**G proteins**: Molecular switches (on/off)

**Components:**
- **GPCR**: 7-transmembrane receptor
- **G protein**: Has 3 subunits (α, β, γ)
- **Effector enzyme**: Produces second messenger

**How it works:**
1. Ligand binds GPCR
2. GPCR activates G protein
3. G protein (α subunit with GTP) activates effector enzyme
4. Effector produces second messenger
5. Second messenger triggers response
6. GTP → GDP, G protein returns to inactive state

**Examples of effector enzymes:**
- Adenylyl cyclase → produces cAMP
- Phospholipase C → produces IP₃ and DAG

### RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE PATHWAY

**RTK mechanism:**
1. Ligand (e.g., growth factor) binds
2. Two RTK monomers dimerize
3. Tyrosine residues phosphorylate each other
4. Phosphorylated tyrosines become docking sites
5. Relay proteins bind and activate
6. Multiple pathways activated simultaneously

**Key pathway: Ras-MAPK**
- Ras = small G protein
- MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase
- Controls cell growth and division
- **Mutant Ras found in ~30% of cancers!**

---

## 📬 SECOND MESSENGERS

### OVERVIEW

**Second messenger**: Small molecule that relays signal inside cell

**First messenger** = ligand (outside cell)
**Second messenger** = relay molecule (inside cell)

**Properties:**
- Small molecules or ions
- Produced rapidly
- Can diffuse quickly through cytoplasm
- Amplify signal enormously
- Quickly degraded (short-lived signal)

### COMMON SECOND MESSENGERS

| Second Messenger | Produced By | Activates |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **cAMP** | Adenylyl cyclase | Protein kinase A (PKA) |
| **cGMP** | Guanylyl cyclase | Protein kinase G (PKG) |
| **IP₃** | Phospholipase C | Ca²⁺ release from ER |
| **DAG** | Phospholipase C | Protein kinase C (PKC) |
| **Ca²⁺** | Released from ER | Calmodulin, many others |

### cAMP PATHWAY

**Classic example: Epinephrine (fight-or-flight)**

**Pathway:**
1. Epinephrine binds β-adrenergic receptor (GPCR)
2. G protein activates adenylyl cyclase
3. Adenylyl cyclase: ATP → cAMP
4. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA)
5. PKA phosphorylates target proteins
6. Response: glycogen breakdown → glucose release

**Amplification:**
- 1 epinephrine molecule
- Activates many G proteins
- Each adenylyl cyclase makes many cAMP
- Each PKA phosphorylates many targets
- **Millions of glucose molecules released!**

**cAMP degradation:**
- Phosphodiesterase: cAMP → AMP
- Terminates signal quickly

### CALCIUM SIGNALING

**Ca²⁺ = versatile second messenger**

**Normally low in cytoplasm:**
- [Ca²⁺] = ~100 nM in cytoplasm
- [Ca²⁺] = ~1 mM outside cell and in ER
- **10,000× gradient!**

**IP₃-Ca²⁺ pathway:**
1. Ligand binds GPCR
2. Phospholipase C activated
3. PIP₂ → IP₃ + DAG
4. IP₃ binds ER receptor
5. Ca²⁺ released from ER
6. Ca²⁺ binds calmodulin
7. Ca²⁺-calmodulin activates target proteins

**Calcium functions:**
- Muscle contraction
- Neurotransmitter release
- Fertilization
- Cell division
- Gene expression

## 📊 CELLULAR RESPONSES

### TYPES OF RESPONSES

**Fast responses** (seconds to minutes):
- Enzyme activation/deactivation
- Ion channel opening
- Cytoskeleton changes
- Secretion

**Slow responses** (minutes to hours):
- Gene expression changes
- Protein synthesis
- Cell growth/division

### SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION

**Each step amplifies signal:**

```
1 ligand → 10 G proteins → 100 effector enzymes
    → 1000 second messengers → 10,000 kinases
    → 100,000 target proteins → HUGE RESPONSE
```

**One epinephrine → millions of glucose molecules!**

### SIGNAL SPECIFICITY

**Same signal, different responses:**

| Signal | Cell Type | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Epinephrine | Liver cell | Glycogen breakdown |
| Epinephrine | Heart cell | Increased heart rate |
| Epinephrine | Smooth muscle | Relaxation |

**How?**
- Different receptors
- Different relay proteins
- Different target proteins

### SIGNAL TERMINATION

**Signal must be turned off:**

| Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Ligand degraded | Neurotransmitter breakdown |
| Ligand removed | Reuptake at synapse |
| Receptor internalized | Receptor endocytosis |
| Second messenger degraded | cAMP → AMP by phosphodiesterase |
| Protein dephosphorylated | Phosphatases remove phosphate |
| Negative feedback | Product inhibits earlier step |

## 🔄 THE CELL CYCLE

### OVERVIEW

**Cell cycle**: Ordered sequence of events for cell growth and division

**Two main phases:**
1. **Interphase**: Cell grows and replicates DNA (~90% of cycle)
2. **M phase (Mitotic phase)**: Cell divides

### INTERPHASE

**Three stages:**

| Stage | Name | Events |
|-------|------|--------|
| **G₁** | Gap 1 | Cell growth, organelle synthesis, normal functions |
| **S** | Synthesis | DNA replication |
| **G₂** | Gap 2 | More growth, preparation for division |

**G₀ phase**: Non-dividing state
- Some cells exit cycle permanently (neurons, muscle)
- Some cells can re-enter if needed

### G₁ PHASE

**"Gap 1" - First growth phase**

**Events:**
- Cell grows in size
- Synthesizes proteins and organelles
- Carries out normal functions
- Prepares for DNA replication

**Duration:** Variable (hours to years)

**G₁ checkpoint**: Decision point
- Enough nutrients?
- Cell large enough?
- DNA damaged?
- Growth signals present?

**If conditions not met → G₀**

### S PHASE

**"Synthesis" - DNA replication**

**Events:**
- Each chromosome replicated
- Results in sister chromatids (joined at centromere)
- Histones synthesized
- Centrosome duplicated

**Duration:** ~6-8 hours typically

**After S phase:**
- Each chromosome = 2 sister chromatids
- Joined at centromere
- 2× DNA content (but same chromosome number)

### G₂ PHASE

**"Gap 2" - Second growth phase**

**Events:**
- More cell growth
- Protein synthesis
- Prepare for mitosis
- Replicate centrioles (in animal cells)

**Duration:** ~4-6 hours typically

**G₂ checkpoint:**
- Is all DNA replicated?
- Is DNA damaged?
- Is cell large enough?

## 🔬 MITOSIS

### OVERVIEW

**Mitosis**: Division of nucleus into two identical nuclei

**Purpose:**
- Growth
- Repair/replacement
- Asexual reproduction

**Result:** 2 genetically identical daughter cells

### MITOSIS PHASES

**PMAT mnemonic:** Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase

### PROPHASE

**"First stage"**

**Events:**
- Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
- Nucleolus disappears
- Nuclear envelope breaks down
- Centrosomes move to opposite poles
- Mitotic spindle begins forming

**Key features:**
- Chromosomes visible (each = 2 sister chromatids)
- Kinetochores form at centromeres

### PROMETAPHASE

**"Before metaphase" (sometimes grouped with prophase)**

**Events:**
- Nuclear envelope completely gone
- Spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores
- Chromosomes begin moving toward center

### METAPHASE

**"Middle stage"**

**Events:**
- Chromosomes align at metaphase plate (cell equator)
- Each chromosome attached to spindles from both poles
- Maximum condensation

**Metaphase checkpoint:**
- Are all chromosomes properly attached?
- If not → pause until fixed

### ANAPHASE

**"Away/apart stage"**

**Events:**
- Sister chromatids separate (now called chromosomes)
- Chromosomes pulled to opposite poles
- Motor proteins "walk" along spindle microtubules
- Cell elongates

**Two processes:**
- **Anaphase A**: Kinetochore microtubules shorten, pull chromosomes
- **Anaphase B**: Non-kinetochore microtubules lengthen, push poles apart

### TELOPHASE

**"End stage"**

**Events:**
- Chromosomes arrive at poles
- Nuclear envelopes reform
- Chromosomes decondense
- Nucleoli reappear
- Spindle disappears

**Result:** Two nuclei with identical chromosomes

## ✂️ CYTOKINESIS

### OVERVIEW

**Cytokinesis**: Division of cytoplasm

**Usually overlaps with telophase**

### ANIMAL CELLS

**Cleavage furrow:**
- Contractile ring of actin and myosin
- Pinches cell in middle
- Forms two daughter cells

```
    Cell at metaphase:      Cleavage furrow:
    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌────┐   ┌────┐
    │        │        │ →  │    └───┘    │
    │   ●    │    ●   │    │    ┌───┐    │
    └─────────────────┘    └────┘   └────┘
```

### PLANT CELLS

**Cell plate:**
- Cannot pinch (rigid cell wall)
- Vesicles from Golgi fuse at center
- Form cell plate (becomes new cell wall)
- Grows outward until reaches existing walls

**Cell plate** → new plasma membranes and cell wall

### RESULT OF CELL DIVISION

**Mitosis + cytokinesis produces:**
- 2 daughter cells
- Same chromosome number as parent
- Genetically identical (clones)
- Smaller initially, will grow during G₁

---

## ⚙️ CELL CYCLE REGULATION

### CHECKPOINTS

**Three main checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint | Location | Questions Asked |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **G₁ checkpoint** | End of G₁ | Environment favorable? DNA damaged? Cell big enough? |
| **G₂ checkpoint** | End of G₂ | All DNA replicated? DNA damaged? Cell big enough? |
| **M checkpoint** | Metaphase | All chromosomes attached to spindle? |

**If checkpoint not passed:**
- Cell cycle pauses
- Cell repairs problems
- Or enters G₀
- Or undergoes apoptosis

### CYCLINS AND CDKs

**Key regulators:**
- **Cyclin**: Regulatory protein (levels cycle up and down)
- **CDK**: Cyclin-dependent kinase (enzyme, always present)

**How they work:**
- CDK alone = inactive
- CDK + cyclin = active complex
- Active CDK phosphorylates target proteins
- Drives cell cycle forward

**Different cyclins for different stages:**
- G₁ cyclins (D cyclins) + CDK4/6 → G₁ progression
- G₁/S cyclins (E cyclins) + CDK2 → S phase entry
- S cyclins (A cyclins) + CDK2 → DNA replication
- M cyclins (B cyclins) + CDK1 → Mitosis entry

### CYCLIN OSCILLATION

**Cyclin levels fluctuate:**

```
      M cyclin
        ↗↘
       /  \     G₁ cyclin
      /    ↘   /      \
─────/──────↘─/────────↘──────
    G₁   S   G₂   M    G₁  S
```

**Mechanism:**
1. Cyclin synthesized → binds CDK → active
2. CDK drives next phase
3. Cyclin degraded (ubiquitin-proteasome)
4. Next cyclin synthesized
5. Cycle continues

### MPF (MATURATION PROMOTING FACTOR)

**MPF = M-cyclin + CDK1**

**Triggers entry into M phase:**
- Phosphorylates proteins for chromosome condensation
- Phosphorylates nuclear lamins (breakdown nuclear envelope)
- Activates spindle formation

**MPF inactivation:**
- M-cyclin degraded
- Allows exit from mitosis

### GROWTH FACTORS

**External signals that stimulate division:**

**Examples:**
- PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) - wound healing
- EGF (epidermal growth factor) - skin cell division
- NGF (nerve growth factor) - neuron survival

**Growth factor signaling:**
1. Growth factor binds RTK
2. Signal transduction cascade
3. Activates genes for G₁ cyclins
4. Cell enters S phase

### DENSITY-DEPENDENT INHIBITION

**Contact inhibition:**
- Cells stop dividing when too crowded
- Cell-cell contact signals "stop"
- Normal cells exhibit this

**Cancer cells:**
- Lose contact inhibition
- Keep dividing
- Pile up

### ANCHORAGE DEPENDENCE

**Normal cells:**
- Must be attached to substrate to divide
- ECM signals needed

**Cancer cells:**
- Can divide without attachment
- Can form tumors in suspension

## 🧬 MEIOSIS

### OVERVIEW

**Meiosis**: Cell division that produces gametes (sex cells)

**Key differences from mitosis:**

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Divisions** | 1 | 2 |
| **Daughter cells** | 2 | 4 |
| **Chromosome number** | Same (2n → 2n) | Halved (2n → n) |
| **Genetic diversity** | Identical to parent | Unique combinations |
| **Purpose** | Growth, repair | Sexual reproduction |

### MEIOSIS I vs MEIOSIS II

**Meiosis I**: Reduction division (separates homologs)
**Meiosis II**: Similar to mitosis (separates sister chromatids)

### MEIOSIS I STAGES

**Prophase I:**
- Chromosomes condense
- Homologous pairs find each other (synapsis)
- Tetrad/bivalent forms (4 chromatids together)
- **Crossing over occurs!**
- Nuclear envelope breaks down

**Crossing over:**
- Non-sister chromatids exchange segments
- Creates recombinant chromosomes
- **Major source of genetic diversity!**

**Metaphase I:**
- Tetrads align at metaphase plate
- Homologs pair up (not individual chromosomes)
- **Independent assortment:** Random orientation

**Anaphase I:**
- Homologous chromosomes separate
- Sister chromatids stay together
- One of each homolog to each pole

**Telophase I / Cytokinesis I:**
- Two cells form
- Each has half the chromosomes (n)
- Each chromosome still has 2 chromatids

### MEIOSIS II STAGES

**Similar to mitosis!**

**Prophase II:**
- Chromosomes condense (if decondensed)
- Spindle forms

**Metaphase II:**
- Chromosomes align at metaphase plate
- Individual chromosomes (not pairs)

**Anaphase II:**
- Sister chromatids separate
- Move to opposite poles

**Telophase II / Cytokinesis II:**
- Four haploid cells form
- Each cell has n chromosomes
- Each chromosome has 1 chromatid

### GENETIC DIVERSITY IN MEIOSIS

**Three sources:**

**1. Crossing over (Prophase I):**
- Creates new combinations of alleles
- Recombinant chromosomes

**2. Independent assortment (Metaphase I):**
- Random orientation of homologous pairs
- $2^n$ possible combinations
- Humans: $2^{23}$ = 8.4 million combinations!

**3. Random fertilization:**
- Any sperm can fertilize any egg
- $(2^{23}) × (2^{23})$ = 70 trillion combinations!

## 🦀 CANCER AND CELL CYCLE DYSFUNCTION

### WHAT IS CANCER?

**Cancer**: Uncontrolled cell division

**Properties of cancer cells:**
- ❌ Ignore stop signals
- ❌ Evade growth inhibition
- ❌ Divide without growth factors
- ❌ Avoid apoptosis
- ❌ Immortal (unlimited divisions)
- ❌ Angiogenesis (form blood vessels)
- ❌ Metastasis (spread to other tissues)

### PROTO-ONCOGENES AND ONCOGENES

**Proto-oncogene**: Normal gene that promotes cell division
- When mutated → **oncogene**
- Oncogene = accelerator stuck ON

**Examples:**
- **Ras**: G protein in growth factor pathway
  - Mutant Ras always active
  - Cell divides constantly
  - Found in ~30% of cancers

- **Myc**: Transcription factor
  - Mutant Myc overexpressed
  - Promotes cell cycle genes

### TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES

**Tumor suppressor**: Gene that slows cell division or promotes apoptosis
- When mutated → lose brakes on cell cycle

**Examples:**

**p53**: "Guardian of the genome"
- Checks for DNA damage
- Pauses cell cycle for repair
- Triggers apoptosis if irreparable
- Mutated in >50% of cancers!

**Rb (Retinoblastoma):**
- Blocks G₁ → S transition
- Mutant Rb: cells enter S without permission

**BRCA1/BRCA2:**
- DNA repair genes
- Mutations increase breast/ovarian cancer risk

### TWO-HIT HYPOTHESIS

**For tumor suppressor genes:**
- Need to lose BOTH copies for cancer
- First hit: One allele mutated (inherited or acquired)
- Second hit: Other allele mutated
- Now no functional tumor suppressor

**For oncogenes:**
- Only need ONE copy mutated
- Dominant effect

### MULTI-STEP MODEL OF CANCER

**Cancer requires multiple mutations:**

1. First mutation: Cell divides more
2. Second mutation: Ignores growth inhibition
3. Third mutation: Avoids apoptosis
4. Fourth mutation: Unlimited divisions
5. Fifth mutation: Angiogenesis
6. Sixth mutation: Metastasis

**Takes years/decades to accumulate mutations**

### CAUSES OF MUTATIONS

| Agent | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Radiation** | UV light, X-rays |
| **Chemicals** | Tobacco, asbestos |
| **Viruses** | HPV, hepatitis B |
| **Inherited mutations** | BRCA1/2, p53 |
| **Spontaneous errors** | DNA replication mistakes |

## 🧮 PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES

### CELL SIGNALING PROBLEMS

1. **Identify signal type** (paracrine, endocrine, etc.)
2. **Trace the pathway**: Receptor → transduction → response
3. **Look for amplification** steps
4. **Consider specificity** (same signal, different responses)

### CELL CYCLE PROBLEMS

1. **Identify the phase** (G₁, S, G₂, M)
2. **Count chromosomes and chromatids**
3. **Consider checkpoints** and regulation
4. **Compare mitosis vs meiosis**

### CHROMOSOME COUNTING

| Phase | Chromosomes | DNA Molecules | Ploidy |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| G₁ | 2n = 46 | 46 | Diploid |
| S (after) | 2n = 46 | 92 | Diploid |
| G₂ | 2n = 46 | 92 | Diploid |
| After Meiosis I | n = 23 | 46 | Haploid |
| After Meiosis II | n = 23 | 23 | Haploid |

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Confusing receptor types**
✅ GPCRs activate G proteins; RTKs phosphorylate themselves

❌ **Thinking second messengers are proteins**
✅ Second messengers are small molecules (cAMP, Ca²⁺, IP₃)

❌ **Confusing interphase with "resting"**
✅ Interphase is very active - most of cell's life!

❌ **Mixing up mitosis and cytokinesis**
✅ Mitosis = nuclear division; cytokinesis = cytoplasm division

❌ **Confusing meiosis stages**
✅ Meiosis I separates homologs; Meiosis II separates sister chromatids

❌ **Thinking all mutations cause cancer**
✅ Cancer requires multiple specific mutations
