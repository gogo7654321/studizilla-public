## 🎼 3.1 The Major Scale

### Major Scale Structure

```
MAJOR SCALE PATTERN:
Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half
   W    W    H    W    W    W    H

C MAJOR SCALE:
C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C
  W   W   H   W   W   W   H

┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ C │ D │ E │ F │ G │ A │ B │ C │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
  W   W   H   W   W   W   H

The two half steps: 3-4 and 7-8
```

### Scale Degree Names

```
SCALE DEGREE NAMES:

1 - TONIC         (home base)
2 - SUPERTONIC    (above tonic)
3 - MEDIANT       (middle of triad)
4 - SUBDOMINANT   (5th below tonic)
5 - DOMINANT      (5th above tonic)
6 - SUBMEDIANT    (between subdominant and tonic)
7 - LEADING TONE  (leads to tonic)
8 - TONIC         (octave)

Memory: The DOMINANT (5) dominates.
        The LEADING TONE (7) leads home.
```

### Scale Degree Functions

```
FUNCTIONAL GROUPS:

TONIC FUNCTION (Stable):
- 1 (Tonic)
- 3 (Mediant)
- 6 (Submediant)

DOMINANT FUNCTION (Tension):
- 5 (Dominant)
- 7 (Leading Tone)

SUBDOMINANT FUNCTION (Away):
- 2 (Supertonic)
- 4 (Subdominant)

Progression: Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic
(Rest → Away → Tension → Resolution)
```

## 🔑 3.2 Key Signatures

### Sharp Key Signatures

```
ORDER OF SHARPS: F C G D A E B
"Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle"

KEY          SHARPS
C major      None
G major      F♯
D major      F♯ C♯
A major      F♯ C♯ G♯
E major      F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯
B major      F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯ A♯
F♯ major     F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯
C♯ major     F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯

To find major key from sharps:
Go UP a half step from last sharp
Example: Last sharp is G♯ → Key is A major
```

### Flat Key Signatures

```
ORDER OF FLATS: B E A D G C F
"Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father"
(Reverse of sharps!)

KEY          FLATS
C major      None
F major      B♭
B♭ major     B♭ E♭
E♭ major     B♭ E♭ A♭
A♭ major     B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭
D♭ major     B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ G♭
G♭ major     B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ G♭ C♭
C♭ major     B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ G♭ C♭ F♭

To find major key from flats:
Second-to-last flat IS the key
Example: B♭ E♭ A♭ → Key is E♭ major
(Exception: 1 flat = F major)
```

### The Circle of Fifths

```
           C
        F     G
     B♭         D
    E♭           A
     A♭         E
        D♭   B/C♭
          F♯/G♭

CLOCKWISE: Add sharps (up a 5th)
C → G → D → A → E → B → F♯ → C♯

COUNTER-CLOCKWISE: Add flats (up a 4th)
C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A♭ → D♭ → G♭ → C♭

ENHARMONIC KEYS:
B = C♭    F♯ = G♭    C♯ = D♭
```

## 🎵 3.3 Minor Scales

### Natural Minor Scale

```
NATURAL MINOR PATTERN:
W-H-W-W-H-W-W

A NATURAL MINOR:
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A
  W   H   W   W   H   W   W

┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ A │ B │ C │ D │ E │ F │ G │ A │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
  
Half steps: 2-3 and 5-6
(Different from major!)
```

### Harmonic Minor Scale

```
HARMONIC MINOR:
Raise the 7th degree of natural minor

A HARMONIC MINOR:
A   B   C   D   E   F   G♯  A
  W   H   W   W   H  1½   H

The RAISED 7th creates LEADING TONE
Interval from 6-7: Augmented 2nd (1½ steps)

WHY: Creates V-i cadence with major V chord
G♯ leads strongly to A
```

### Melodic Minor Scale

```
MELODIC MINOR:
Different ascending and descending

ASCENDING: Raise 6 and 7
A   B   C   D   E   F♯  G♯  A

DESCENDING: Natural minor
A   G   F   E   D   C   B   A

WHY: 
- Ascending: Smooth melody, leading tone
- Descending: Natural minor color

In jazz: Use ascending form both ways
(Called "jazz melodic minor")
```

### Comparing Minor Scales

```
COMPARISON TABLE:

Scale Degree:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

Natural:       A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A
Harmonic:      A   B   C   D   E   F   G♯  A
Melodic ↑:     A   B   C   D   E   F♯  G♯  A
Melodic ↓:     A   G   F   E   D   C   B   A

KEY DIFFERENCES:
Natural: Both 6 and 7 lowered
Harmonic: Only raised 7
Melodic up: Raised 6 and 7
Melodic down: Same as natural
```

---

## 🔗 3.4 Relative and Parallel Keys

### Relative Keys

```
RELATIVE KEYS:
Share the same key signature

MAJOR → RELATIVE MINOR:
Go DOWN a minor 3rd (or up a major 6th)

C major → A minor (no sharps/flats)
G major → E minor (1 sharp)
F major → D minor (1 flat)

MINOR → RELATIVE MAJOR:
Go UP a minor 3rd

A minor → C major
E minor → G major
D minor → F major
```

### Relative Key Table

```

### Parallel Keys

```
PARALLEL KEYS:
Same tonic, different mode

C MAJOR and C MINOR (parallel)
- Same starting note
- Different key signatures

C major: No sharps/flats
C minor: 3 flats (B♭ E♭ A♭)

Difference: 3 notes changed
Major: 3, 6, 7 = E, A, B
Minor: 3, 6, 7 = E♭, A♭, B♭
```

AEOLIAN (Natural Minor): A B C D E F G A
LOCRIAN:            B C D E F G A B

Each starts on different note of C major
Same notes, different tonic!
```

### Mode Characteristics

```
MODE QUALITIES:

IONIAN (Major):
W-W-H-W-W-W-H
Bright, stable, happy

DORIAN:
W-H-W-W-W-H-W
Minor with raised 6th
Jazz, folk, medieval

PHRYGIAN:
H-W-W-W-H-W-W
Minor with lowered 2nd
Spanish, flamenco feel

```

### Building Modes on Any Note

```
D DORIAN (on D):
D E F G A B C D
(Same as C major but starting on D)

D LYDIAN (on D):
D E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D
(Same as A major but starting on D)

FORMULA:
To play MODE on NOTE:
1. Find the major scale where NOTE is that degree
2. Play from NOTE to NOTE using that scale

D Mixolydian = G major starting on D
D Phrygian = B♭ major starting on D
```

## 🌈 3.6 Other Scale Types

### Pentatonic Scales

```
MAJOR PENTATONIC:
5-note scale (remove 4 and 7)

C major pentatonic:
C   D   E   G   A   (C)
1   2   3   5   6

No half steps = very consonant
Used in folk, rock, Asian music

MINOR PENTATONIC:
5-note scale (remove 2 and 6)

A minor pentatonic:
A   C   D   E   G   (A)
1   ♭3  4   5   ♭7

Very common in blues and rock
```

### Blues Scale

```
BLUES SCALE:
Minor pentatonic + blue note (♭5)

A blues scale:
A   C   D   E♭  E   G   (A)
1   ♭3  4   ♭5  5   ♭7

The ♭5 (E♭) is the "blue note"
Creates tension and color
```

### Chromatic Scale

```
CHROMATIC SCALE:
All 12 pitches, all half steps

C   C♯  D   D♯  E   F   F♯  G   G♯  A   A♯  B   C
    D♭      E♭          G♭      A♭      B♭

12 half steps to the octave
No tonal center
Used for runs, passing tones
```

### Whole Tone Scale

```
WHOLE TONE SCALE:
All whole steps, 6 notes

C   D   E   F♯  G♯  A♯  (C)
  W   W   W   W   W   W

Only 2 possible whole tone scales:
1. C-D-E-F♯-G♯-A♯
2. D♭-E♭-F-G-A-B

Dreamy, floating quality
Debussy used extensively
```

## 📏 3.7 Writing Scales

### Scale Writing Guidelines

```
RULES FOR SCALE WRITING:

1. USE EACH LETTER ONCE
   C D E F G A B (not C D D♯ F...)

2. CORRECT ACCIDENTALS
   Use sharps or flats consistently
   Match key signature

3. ASCENDING/DESCENDING
   Ascending: left to right, up
   Descending: right to left, down

4. CHECK HALF STEPS
   Major: 3-4 and 7-8
   Natural minor: 2-3 and 5-6
```

### Spelling Enharmonic Keys

```
ENHARMONIC SPELLING:

B major and C♭ major:
B  C♯  D♯  E  F♯  G♯  A♯  B   (5 sharps)
C♭ D♭  E♭  F♭ G♭  A♭  B♭  C♭  (7 flats)
SAME SOUND, different notation

When to use which?
- Simpler key signature preferred
- Context determines choice
- Modulation may require enharmonic
```

---

## ⚡ 3.8 Key Relationships

### Closely Related Keys

```
CLOSELY RELATED KEYS:
Differ by only one accidental

From C major:
- G major (add F♯)
- F major (add B♭)
- A minor (relative)
- D minor (relative of F)
- E minor (relative of G)

TOTAL: 5 closely related keys
(Circle of 5ths neighbors + relatives)
```

### Distant Keys

```
DISTANT KEYS:
Differ by multiple accidentals

From C major:
- C♯ major (7 sharps away)
- F♯ major (6 sharps away)

Modulation between distant keys
requires careful preparation
(Common tones, pivot chords)
```

### Parallel Mode Change

```
MODE CHANGE (Modal interchange):
Switch between parallel major/minor

C major → C minor
Same tonic, different mode
Common in classical and pop

"Borrowed chords" come from
parallel mode
```

```
1. MAJOR SCALE IS THE FOUNDATION
   - W W H W W W H pattern
   - All other scales relate to it
   - Key signatures derived from it

2. MINOR HAS THREE FORMS
   - Natural: Pure minor sound
   - Harmonic: Creates leading tone
   - Melodic: Smooth voice leading

3. RELATIVE KEYS SHARE NOTES
   - Same key signature
   - Different tonic
   - Down minor 3rd for relative minor

4. MODES ARE ROTATED SCALES
   - Same notes, different starting point
   - Each has unique character
   - Very important in jazz and pop

5. CIRCLE OF FIFTHS ORGANIZES ALL
   - Keys related by fifth
   - Clockwise = add sharps
   - Counter-clockwise = add flats
```

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
QUICK KEY IDENTIFICATION:

SHARPS:
Last sharp + half step = key
F♯ C♯ G♯ → A major

FLATS:
Second-to-last flat = key
B♭ E♭ A♭ → E♭ major
(1 flat: F major)

MINOR KEYS:
Same sig as relative major
Down minor 3rd from major

MODE TRICKS:
Dorian = minor + raised 6
Mixolydian = major + lowered 7
Lydian = major + raised 4
