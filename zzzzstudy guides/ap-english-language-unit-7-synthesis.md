## 🔄 Organizing by Idea

### Source-by-Source (AVOID)

```
Paragraph 1: Source A says...
Paragraph 2: Source B says...
Paragraph 3: Source C says...
```

**Problem:** This is summary, not synthesis!

### Idea-by-Idea (USE THIS)

```
Paragraph 1: [Idea 1]
- Evidence from Source A
- Evidence from Source C

Paragraph 2: [Idea 2]
- Evidence from Source B
- Evidence from Source D

Paragraph 3: [Counterargument/Idea 3]
- Evidence from Source E
- Response using Source A
```

**Benefit:** This is true synthesis!

### Synthesis Matrix

| Idea/Theme | Source A | Source B | Source C |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Academic impact | ✓ supports | - | ✓ supports |
| Economic effects | ✓ concerns | ✓ supports | - |
| Social implications | - | ✓ concerns | ✓ supports |

Use this matrix to plan paragraphs organized by idea, not source!

## 📖 Extended Synthesis Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Agreement Synthesis

**Your Claim:** School start times significantly impact student health.

**Source A:** CDC study showing teen sleep deprivation correlates with later school start times.

**Source C:** American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for 8:30 AM or later starts.

**Synthesized Paragraph:**
> The scientific consensus supporting later school start times is overwhelming. According to the CDC, adolescents who start school before 8:30 AM are significantly more likely to experience chronic sleep deprivation (Source A). This finding is reinforced by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which officially recommends that middle and high schools begin at 8:30 AM or later (Source C). Taken together, these sources establish that the current practice of early start times contradicts established health science, making schedule reform not merely desirable but medically necessary.

| Element | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Topic sentence** | States YOUR claim |
| **Source A** | First evidence |
| **Source C** | Reinforcing evidence |
| **Synthesis** | "Taken together" connects sources |
| **Commentary** | Explains significance |

### Example 2: Disagreement Synthesis

**Your Claim:** The economic argument against later start times is overstated.

**Source B:** School district report citing transportation costs of schedule change.

**Source E:** Study showing long-term economic benefits of better student outcomes.

**Synthesized Paragraph:**
> While economic concerns about later start times are understandable, they rely on short-term thinking. Source B emphasizes the immediate costs of transportation adjustments, including additional bus routes and driver wages. However, Source E's longitudinal study reveals that these upfront costs are dwarfed by long-term benefits: improved graduation rates, higher lifetime earnings, and reduced healthcare costs. By focusing only on immediate expenditures, opponents overlook the substantial return on investment that improved student health generates over time.

| Element | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Concession** | Acknowledges opposition fairly |
| **Source B** | Counterargument evidence |
| **Source E** | Your supporting evidence |
| **Synthesis** | Shows how sources relate |
| **Commentary** | Explains why your position is stronger |

### Example 3: Complication Synthesis

**Your Claim:** The solution requires considering multiple stakeholders.

**Source A:** Focus on student health benefits.

**Source D:** Parent concerns about afternoon supervision.

**Synthesized Paragraph:**
> Any viable proposal must balance competing needs. Source A's compelling data on student health benefits must be weighed against the practical concerns raised in Source D, where parents express worry about unsupervised afternoon hours. However, this apparent conflict dissolves when we recognize that both sources share a fundamental concern: student welfare. Rather than treating these as irreconcilable, schools should develop solutions that address both—perhaps through after-school programming that extends supervision while still allowing later start times.

| Element | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Framing** | Establishes complexity |
| **Source A** | Health perspective |
| **Source D** | Parent perspective |
| **Synthesis** | Finds common ground |
| **Solution** | Your synthesized position |

## ✍️ Sample Thesis Statements

### By Structure

| Structure | Sample Thesis |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Position + reasons** | "Schools should adopt later start times because research demonstrates improved academic performance, better mental health outcomes, and reduced accident rates among adolescents." |
| **Concession + position** | "Although later start times present logistical challenges, the overwhelming evidence of health and academic benefits makes this change necessary." |
| **Complexity acknowledgment** | "The debate over school start times reveals tensions between institutional convenience and student welfare, but when we prioritize the latter, the evidence clearly favors later schedules." |

### By Topic

| Topic | Sample Thesis |
|-------|---------------|
| **Technology** | "While social media platforms have democratized public discourse, the evidence demonstrates that their algorithmic design amplifies division, making regulation essential to preserve democratic dialogue." |
| **Education** | "Standardized testing provides useful data but has narrowed curriculum and exacerbated inequality; schools should shift to competency-based assessment for a more complete picture of student learning." |
| **Environment** | "Individual action alone cannot address climate change; only coordinated government policy can achieve the scale of transformation necessary, making policy advocacy more important than personal lifestyle changes." |
