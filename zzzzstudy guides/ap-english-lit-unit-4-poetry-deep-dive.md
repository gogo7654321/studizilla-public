# 📜 AP English Literature Unit 4: Poetry Deep Dive

## 📚 Unit Overview

This unit explores advanced poetry analysis techniques, examining how form, structure, sound, and imagery work together to create meaning across literary periods and traditions.

---

## 🎯 Sub-Theme 1: Understanding Poetic Form

### Fixed Forms vs. Free Verse

```
FIXED FORMS:
Poetry with established patterns of:
- Line length
- Rhyme scheme
- Stanza structure
- Meter

Examples:
- Sonnet (14 lines, specific rhyme)
- Villanelle (19 lines, two refrains)
- Haiku (3 lines, 5-7-5 syllables)
- Limerick (5 lines, AABBA)

FREE VERSE:
Poetry without regular:
- Meter
- Rhyme scheme
- Line length

Still uses:
- Line breaks for emphasis
- Imagery and figurative language
- Sound devices (internal rhyme, alliteration)
```

### Major Sonnet Types

| Type | Rhyme Scheme | Structure | Origin |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Italian (Petrarchan) | ABBAABBA CDECDE | Octave + Sestet | 14th c. Italy |
| English (Shakespearean) | ABAB CDCD EFEF GG | 3 Quatrains + Couplet | 16th c. England |
| Spenserian | ABAB BCBC CDCD EE | Linked quatrains | Edmund Spenser |
| Miltonic | ABBAABBA + varies | No clear volta | John Milton |

### Sonnet Analysis Framework

```
PETRARCHAN SONNET:
┌──────────────────────┐
│      OCTAVE          │ Lines 1-8
│   (Sets up problem,  │ ABBAABBA
│    question, or      │
│    situation)        │
├──────────────────────┤
│       VOLTA          │ Turn between 8-9
│   (Shift in thought, │
│    "but," "yet")     │
├──────────────────────┤
│      SESTET          │ Lines 9-14
│   (Resolution,       │ CDECDE/CDCDCD
│    answer, or        │
│    complication)     │
└──────────────────────┘

SHAKESPEAREAN SONNET:
┌──────────────────────┐
│    QUATRAIN 1        │ Lines 1-4
│   (Introduce theme)  │ ABAB
├──────────────────────┤
│    QUATRAIN 2        │ Lines 5-8
│   (Develop theme)    │ CDCD
├──────────────────────┤
│    QUATRAIN 3        │ Lines 9-12
│   (Complicate/turn)  │ EFEF
├──────────────────────┤
│    COUPLET           │ Lines 13-14
│   (Resolution/twist) │ GG
└──────────────────────┘
```

### Other Fixed Forms

```
VILLANELLE (19 lines):
- 5 tercets + 1 quatrain
- Two refrains (lines 1 and 3)
- ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA
- Famous example: "Do Not Go Gentle 
  into That Good Night" (Dylan Thomas)

SESTINA (39 lines):
- 6 stanzas of 6 lines + 3-line envoi
- No rhyme, but six repeated end-words
- Complex word rotation pattern
- Famous example: Elizabeth Bishop's "Sestina"

PANTOUM:
- Quatrains with lines repeating
- Lines 2 and 4 become lines 1 and 3
- Creates circular, dream-like effect

ODE:
- Formal address to a subject
- Elevated language
- Often irregular stanzas
- Horatian, Pindaric, or Irregular
```

## 🎵 Sub-Theme 2: Meter and Rhythm

### Understanding Meter

```
METER = Pattern of stressed and 
        unstressed syllables

FOOT = Basic unit of meter
       (combination of stressed/unstressed)

SCANSION = Process of marking meter
           / = stressed (ictus)
           u = unstressed (slack)
```

### Types of Metrical Feet

| Foot | Pattern | Example | Sound Effect |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Iamb | u / | de-LIGHT | Rising, natural speech |
| Trochee | / u | GAR-den | Falling, emphatic |
| Anapest | u u / | in-ter-VENE | Rolling, quick |
| Dactyl | / u u | BEAU-ti-ful | Falling, waltz-like |
| Spondee | / / | HEART-BREAK | Heavy, emphatic |
| Pyrrhic | u u | of the | Light, transitional |

### Line Lengths

| Term | Feet per Line | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Monometer | 1 foot | "Thus I" |
| Dimeter | 2 feet | "The way a crow" |
| Trimeter | 3 feet | "The only news I know" |
| Tetrameter | 4 feet | "Because I could not stop for Death" |
| Pentameter | 5 feet | Most common in English |
| Hexameter | 6 feet | Alexandrine (French) |
| Heptameter | 7 feet | Common in ballads |

### Scanning Poetry

```
IAMBIC PENTAMETER:
u   /    u   /    u  /   u  /    u    /
Shall I | com-PARE | thee TO | a SUM | mer's DAY?

TROCHAIC TETRAMETER:
 /    u    /   u    /   u    /   u
DOUB-le, | DOUB-le, | TOIL and | TROU-ble

ANAPESTIC TRIMETER:
u    u   /    u  u    /    u   u   /
And the SOUND | of a VOICE | that is STILL

Tips for Scanning:
1. Read aloud naturally
2. Mark obvious stresses
3. Look for patterns
4. Allow for substitutions
5. Check against known meter
```

### Variations and Substitutions

```
Poets vary meter for effect:

SUBSTITUTION:
Replacing expected foot with different one
- Trochee for iamb at line start
- Spondee for emphasis

CATALEXIS:
Dropping final unstressed syllable
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright" (missing final u)

FEMININE ENDING:
Extra unstressed syllable at line end
"To BE or NOT to BE, that IS the QUES-tion"
                              (extra -tion)

CAESURA:
Strong pause within a line
"To be, or not to be: || that is the question"

ENJAMBMENT:
Running sentence across line break
"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree"
```

### Meter and Meaning

```
FAST METERS (anapests, dactyls):
- Movement, excitement
- Lightness, speed
- Often in comic or narrative verse

SLOW METERS (spondees, heavy iambs):
- Weight, seriousness
- Grief, contemplation
- Emphasis on content

REGULAR METER:
- Order, control
- Tradition, formality
- Can feel sing-song if too regular

IRREGULAR METER:
- Tension, disruption
- Naturalness
- Emotional turbulence

Example Analysis:
"Break, break, break,
On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!"
               - Tennyson

Three spondees (BREAK, BREAK, BREAK) 
create the pounding rhythm of waves 
and echo the speaker's grief.
```

INTERNAL RHYME:
Words rhyme within a line
"Once upon a midnight dreary, 
while I pondered, weak and weary"

SLANT RHYME (Near/Half):

Long vowels: oh, oo, ah
Effects: Beauty, peace, flowing
Example: "The murmuring of innumerable 
         bees on summer days"

→ All connect to theme of 
  escaping mortal suffering

CONTRAST ANALYSIS:
- Light vs. dark
- Nature vs. urban

## 📐 Sub-Theme 5: Structure and Organization

### Stanza Types

| Stanza | Lines | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Couplet | 2 | Often rhymed, epigrammatic |
| Tercet | 3 | Used in villanelles, terza rima |
| Quatrain | 4 | Most common, versatile |
| Quintet | 5 | Less common, limericks |
| Sestet | 6 | Sonnet second part |
| Septet | 7 | Rhyme royal |
| Octave | 8 | Sonnet first part |

### Structural Patterns

```
LINEAR STRUCTURE:
Beginning → Middle → End
- Narrative poems
- Clear progression
- Temporal sequence

CIRCULAR STRUCTURE:
Returns to beginning
- Creates frame
- Emphasizes change/sameness
- "Dover Beach" effect

ASSOCIATIVE STRUCTURE:
Connected by images, ideas
- Stream of consciousness
- Emotional logic
- Free verse often

PARALLEL STRUCTURE:
Repeated syntactical patterns
- Creates rhythm
- Emphasizes comparison
- Whitman's catalogues
```

### Enjambment vs. End-Stop

```
END-STOPPED LINE:
Complete thought at line end
"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day."
Effect: Closure, formality, weight

ENJAMBED LINE:
Thought continues to next line
"I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon..."
Effect: Speed, continuation, emphasis on run-on word

Strategic enjambment creates:
- Suspense (what's coming next?)
- Emphasis (run-on word highlighted)
- Momentum (keeps reader moving)
- Surprise (unexpected completion)
```

### Volta and Shifts

```
VOLTA:
Turn or shift in thought/emotion
- Common in sonnets
- Creates contrast, resolution
- Signal words: but, yet, however, still

Types of Shifts:
- Problem → Solution
- Question → Answer
- Past → Present
- General → Specific
- External → Internal
- Despair → Hope

Finding the Turn:
1. Look for conjunctions
2. Note tense changes
3. Identify perspective shifts
4. Observe imagery changes
5. Notice emotional transitions
```

## 🎭 Sub-Theme 6: Voice and Perspective

### Speaker vs. Poet

```
Important distinction:

POET = Real person who wrote the poem

SPEAKER = Voice/persona in the poem
- May or may not be the poet
- Could be a character
- Could be persona adopted

NEVER assume speaker = poet!

Example:
Browning's "My Last Duchess"
- Speaker: Duke (murderous, controlling)
- Poet: Browning (critiquing Duke)
```

### Types of Speakers

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Personal | Uses "I," autobiographical feel | Confessional poetry |
| Persona | Adopted character | Dramatic monologue |
| Collective | "We" voice | Community perspective |
| Impersonal | No clear speaker | Some modernist work |
| Addressee-focused | "You" prominent | Direct address |

### Tone in Poetry

```
Analyzing Tone:

DICTION → TONE
- Formal words = serious, elevated
- Informal words = casual, intimate
- Archaic words = timeless, ceremonial
- Technical words = precise, intellectual

SYNTAX → TONE
- Long sentences = contemplative
- Short sentences = urgent, emphatic
- Questions = uncertainty, engagement
- Imperatives = commanding

IMAGERY → TONE
- Dark imagery = somber, threatening
- Bright imagery = hopeful, cheerful
- Violent imagery = angry, chaotic
- Soft imagery = gentle, peaceful
```

### Tone Vocabulary

```
POSITIVE TONES:
reverent, affectionate, exuberant, 
hopeful, whimsical, playful, 
celebratory, serene, tender

NEGATIVE TONES:
melancholic, bitter, despairing,
caustic, indignant, mournful,
ominous, sardonic, contemptuous

NEUTRAL/COMPLEX TONES:
detached, ironic, reflective,
ambivalent, nostalgic, resigned,
wistful, pensive, philosophical

TONE CAN SHIFT:
Track tonal changes through poem
- Beginning to end
- Before/after volta
- In response to events
```

## ✍️ Sub-Theme 8: Writing About Poetry

### Poetry Analysis Framework

```
S.O.A.P.S.Tone + Structure:

SPEAKER: Who is speaking?
OCCASION: What prompted the poem?
AUDIENCE: Who is being addressed?
PURPOSE: Why was this written?
SUBJECT: What is it about?
TONE: What is the attitude?
STRUCTURE: How is it organized?
```

### Close Reading Steps

```
1. FIRST READ:
   - Overall impression
   - Basic meaning
   - Initial reactions

2. SECOND READ:
   - Mark sound devices
   - Note imagery
   - Track speaker/tone

3. THIRD READ:
   - Scan meter
   - Analyze structure
   - Find patterns

4. ANALYSIS:
   - Connect devices to meaning
   - Identify themes
   - Develop interpretation
```

### Strong Poetry Thesis

```
WEAK:
"This poem uses many poetic devices."
"The poet describes nature beautifully."

STRONG:
"Through jarring enjambment and cacophonous 
diction, Hopkins conveys the speaker's 
spiritual anguish at nature's destruction."

"Dickinson's strategic dashes and slant 
rhymes create a sense of instability that 
mirrors the speaker's uncertain relationship 
with death."

Formula:
Through [specific techniques], the speaker/poet
conveys/creates/reveals [specific effect/meaning]
to suggest/illuminate [theme/insight].
```

### Evidence and Analysis

```
QUOTING POETRY:
- Use / to mark line breaks
- Use // for stanza breaks
- Keep original spelling/punctuation
- Cite line numbers (lines 3-4)

Example:
The speaker's desperation intensifies 
in the urgent repetition: "Do not go 
gentle into that good night, / Rage, 
rage against the dying of the light" 
(lines 1-2). The imperative "rage" 
breaks the villanelle's soft music 
with harsh consonants, suggesting...

ANALYZING (not just identifying):
❌ "The poem uses alliteration."
✓ "The alliteration of 's' sounds in 
   'silken, sad, uncertain' creates a 
   whispered, ghostly quality that 
   reinforces the speaker's haunted state."
```

## 📝 Practice Poetry Analysis

### Sample Poem Analysis

```
"OZYMANDIAS" by Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away."

ANALYSIS NOTES:
Structure: Modified Petrarchan sonnet
          (unusual rhyme scheme)
Speaker: Narrator reporting traveller's account
         (layers of distance)
Imagery: Ruins, desert, decay
Irony: Ozymandias's boast vs. emptiness
Theme: Transience of power, art outlasts power
Sound: "lone and level" alliteration
       emphasizes emptiness
```
