## Unit 1: Thinking Geographically

### Core Geographic Concepts

**Geography** is the study of the spatial distribution of phenomena across Earth's surface. Human geography specifically examines how humans organize space and place.

#### The Five Themes of Geography

| Theme | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Location** | Where something is (absolute/relative) | 40°N, 74°W (NYC) or "near the Hudson River" |
| **Place** | Physical and human characteristics | NYC has skyscrapers, diverse population |
| **Human-Environment Interaction** | How humans adapt/modify environment | Building levees, terrace farming |
| **Movement** | Flow of people, goods, ideas | Immigration patterns, trade routes |
| **Region** | Areas with unifying characteristics | The Sun Belt, Midwest Corn Belt |

### Types of Location

**Absolute Location**: Precise position using coordinates (latitude/longitude) or street addresses
- Example: The Eiffel Tower is at 48.8584°N, 2.2945°E

**Relative Location**: Position described in relation to other places
- Example: Mexico is south of the United States

### Types of Space

- **Absolute Space**: Measurable, mathematical space (distances, areas)
- **Relative Space**: Defined by connectivity and accessibility
- **Cognitive Space**: Mental maps and perception of places

### Types of Regions

| Region Type | Definition | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Formal (Uniform)** | Defined by homogeneous characteristics | French-speaking Quebec |
| **Functional (Nodal)** | Organized around a central node | Metropolitan area, TV broadcast zone |
| **Perceptual (Vernacular)** | Defined by popular perception | "The South," "Middle East" |

### Scale and Geographic Analysis

**Scale** refers to the level of geographic analysis:
- **Local**: Neighborhood, city
- **Regional**: State, multi-state area
- **National**: Country-wide patterns
- **Global**: Worldwide phenomena

**Scale of Inquiry** affects what patterns are visible and what conclusions can be drawn.

### Maps and Spatial Data
