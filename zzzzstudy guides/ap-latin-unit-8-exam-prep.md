## 📖 Sub-Theme 2: Multiple Choice Strategies

### Question Types

```
TRANSLATION/COMPREHENSION:
"The word 'hostium' (line 3) refers to..."
"In lines 4-6, Caesar states that..."
→ Find in text, understand meaning

GRAMMAR:
"The case and number of 'militibus' is..."
"The word 'viderunt' is what form?"
→ Identify forms accurately

LITERARY/STYLISTIC:
"The effect of the simile in lines 8-10 is..."
"Vergil's word choice in line 5 suggests..."
→ Analyze technique

SCANSION:
"When scanned, line 12 contains..."
"The meter of line 7 is..."
→ Apply metrical knowledge

CONTEXTUAL:
"Based on the passage, the Gauls..."
"Aeneas's reaction suggests..."
→ Interpret character/situation
```

### Reading Strategies

```
FOR SYLLABUS PASSAGES:
- You should recognize these
- Draw on memorized knowledge
- Confirm with close reading
- Don't assume—verify

FOR SIGHT PASSAGES:
- Read entire passage first
- Identify main idea
- Mark key structures
- Use context for vocabulary

TIME MANAGEMENT:
- ~1.2 minutes per question
- Don't get stuck
- Flag difficult questions
- Return with remaining time
```

### Common Traps

```
WATCH OUT FOR:

1. SIMILAR-LOOKING FORMS:
   "horum" vs. "harum" vs. "hōrum"
   → Check gender, number, case

2. VOCABULARY CONFUSION:
   "capio" (take) vs. "cāpio" (I am taken)
   → Long marks matter

3. CONTEXT SHIFTS:
   Answer applies to wrong line
   → Verify line references

4. PARTIAL TRUTHS:
   Answer partially correct
   → Find the BEST answer

5. OVER-INTERPRETATION:
   Reading too much into text
   → Stick to what's stated
```

## ✍️ Sub-Theme 3: Translation Strategies

### Before Translating

```
READ THE PASSAGE:
- Get overall sense
- Note familiar vocabulary
- Identify challenging spots
- Observe punctuation

IDENTIFY STRUCTURES:
- Main clauses
- Subordinate clauses
- Ablative absolutes
- Participle phrases

MARK KEY ELEMENTS:
- Subjects
- Main verbs
- Relative pronouns
- Subordinating conjunctions
```

### Translation Process

```
STEP 1: FIND MAIN VERB(S)
What's the backbone?

STEP 2: FIND SUBJECT(S)
Who/what does the action?

STEP 3: BRACKET SUBORDINATES
[Relative clauses]
[Cum clauses]
[Ablative absolutes]

STEP 4: TRANSLATE MAIN CLAUSE
Get the skeleton

STEP 5: ADD SUBORDINATES
Layer in complexity

STEP 6: SMOOTH ENGLISH
Make it readable
Maintain accuracy
```

### Common Errors to Avoid

```
1. WRONG CASE IDENTIFICATION:
   "militum" = of soldiers (genitive)
   NOT "soldiers" (nominative)

2. PARTICIPLE ERRORS:
   Perfect passive ≠ Present active
   "victus" = having been conquered
   NOT "conquering"

3. TENSE CONFUSION:
   Latin perfect can = English past OR present perfect
   Check context

4. WORD ORDER TRANSFER:
   Latin word order ≠ English
   Reorder for English sense

5. OMISSIONS:
   Every word matters
   Check you've rendered all

6. ADDITIONS:
   Don't add words not there
   Interpretation ≠ translation
```

### Vergil vs. Caesar Translation

```
CAESAR CHALLENGES:
- Long sentences
- Indirect statement chains
- Multiple ablative absolutes
- Military vocabulary
- Pronoun reference

CAESAR HELPS:
- Straightforward word order
- Predictable structures
- Clear logical connections
- Limited metaphor


VERGIL CHALLENGES:
- Poetic word order
- Separated adjective-noun pairs
- Elision
- Figurative language
- Mythological references

VERGIL HELPS:
- Meter constrains options
- Emotional vocabulary often clear
- Epic formulas recognizable
- Syllabus passages familiar
```

## 📝 Sub-Theme 4: Essay Strategies

### Analytical Essay Overview

```
TASK:
Analyze how an author uses literary
devices/techniques to achieve an effect

TIME:
~45 minutes recommended

STRUCTURE:
- Introduction with thesis
- 2-3 body paragraphs
- Conclusion

REQUIREMENTS:
- Clear thesis
- Latin evidence (quotes)
- Accurate translation
- Literary analysis
- Coherent argument
```

### Building Strong Thesis

```
WEAK THESIS:
"Vergil uses literary devices."
"Caesar writes about war."

MODERATE THESIS:
"Vergil uses imagery to create emotion."
"Caesar uses indirect statement to
present enemy perspectives."

STRONG THESIS:
"Through the strategic juxtaposition
of Dido's passionate diction with
Aeneas's restrained responses, Vergil
dramatizes the conflict between personal
desire and public duty, ultimately
suggesting that pietas demands the
sacrifice of eros."
```

### Using Latin Evidence

```
FORMAT:

1. CLAIM:
   State your analytical point

2. EVIDENCE:
   Quote Latin (with line reference)

3. TRANSLATION:
   Render accurately

4. ANALYSIS:
   Explain how it supports claim

EXAMPLE:

CLAIM: "Vergil emphasizes Dido's suffering
through disease imagery."

EVIDENCE: "At regina gravi iamdudum
saucia cura / vulnus alit venis et
caeco carpitur igni" (4.1-2)

TRANSLATION: "But the queen, long since
wounded by heavy care, nourishes the
wound in her veins and is seized by
hidden fire."

ANALYSIS: "The progression from 'saucia'
(wounded) to 'vulnus' (wound) to 'carpitur'
(is seized/consumed) creates an image of
love as disease, consuming Dido from within.
The 'hidden fire' (caeco...igni) suggests
both passion and destruction, foreshadowing
her eventual immolation."
```

### Common Essay Mistakes

```
AVOID:

1. PLOT SUMMARY:
   Telling what happens ≠ analysis
   Always explain WHY and HOW

2. FEATURE SPOTTING:
   "There is alliteration" isn't enough
   Must explain its EFFECT

3. TRANSLATION ERRORS:
   Undermines credibility
   Verify before writing

4. NO THESIS:
   Collection of observations ≠ essay
   Need unified argument

5. IGNORING PROMPT:
   Answer what's asked
   Address all parts

6. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
   One quote isn't enough
   Multiple examples strengthen
```
