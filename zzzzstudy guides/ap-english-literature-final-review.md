## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Thesis Mistakes
❌ **Plot summary instead of analysis**
- Wrong: "In the novel, the character travels to many places."
- Right: "Through the protagonist's physical journey, Author explores the psychological journey toward self-acceptance."

❌ **Vague or obvious claims**
- Wrong: "The author uses imagery to create effects."
- Right: "The author's dark water imagery reflects the protagonist's descent into moral ambiguity."

❌ **Listing without argument**
- Wrong: "Author uses simile, metaphor, and personification."
- Right: "Through personifying nature as a nurturing force, Author argues that humanity finds solace in the natural world."

### Evidence Mistakes
❌ **Dropped quotes**
- Wrong: "The light was green." This shows hope.
- Right: As Nick observes, "the single green light" at the end of Daisy's dock represents Gatsby's unattainable dream.

❌ **Too much summary**
- Wrong: Retelling the plot of the passage
- Right: Analyzing specific moments with quotes

❌ **Identifying without analyzing**
- Wrong: "This is an example of metaphor."
- Right: "This metaphor comparing love to a 'red, red rose' emphasizes both passion and fragility."

### Analysis Mistakes
❌ **"The author uses this to show..."**
- Better: "The author suggests/implies/reveals/argues..."

❌ **Paraphrasing instead of interpreting**
- Wrong: "The speaker says they are sad."
- Right: "The melancholic tone reveals the speaker's profound sense of loss."

❌ **Ignoring the "so what?"**
- Always connect analysis to theme and meaning
- Ask: What does this technique accomplish?

### Open Question Mistakes
❌ **Choosing an unfamiliar work**
- Stick to works you know well
- Have 3-4 versatile works prepared

❌ **Summarizing plot**
- Focus on analysis, not retelling
- Use plot only as needed for context

❌ **Ignoring "meaning of the work as a whole"**
- Must connect to larger theme
- End with significance beyond the text

### General Mistakes
❌ **Running out of time**
- Pace yourself strictly
- A complete essay beats a perfect incomplete one

❌ **Ignoring the prompt**
- Answer what is asked
- Circle key terms in prompt

❌ **Generic conclusions**
