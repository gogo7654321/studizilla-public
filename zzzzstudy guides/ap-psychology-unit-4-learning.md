# 🔔 Classical Conditioning

## 🎯 What Is Classical Conditioning?

Learning through **association**! 🐕

### Definition

A type of learning where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eventually triggering a similar response.

### Ivan Pavlov's Famous Experiment

| Step | What Happened |
|------|---------------|
| Before | Food → Salivation (natural) |
| Training | Bell + Food → Salivation |
| After | Bell alone → Salivation! |

---

## 📋 Key Terms

### The Four Components

| Term | Abbreviation | Definition | In Pavlov's Study |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Unconditioned Stimulus** | UCS | Naturally triggers response | Food |
| **Unconditioned Response** | UCR | Natural, unlearned reaction | Salivation (to food) |
| **Conditioned Stimulus** | CS | Learned trigger (formerly neutral) | Bell |
| **Conditioned Response** | CR | Learned reaction | Salivation (to bell) |

### Memory Aid

- **U** = **U**nlearned (natural)
- **C** = **C**onditioned (learned)
- **S** = **S**timulus (trigger)
- **R** = **R**esponse (reaction)

---

## 📊 The Classical Conditioning Process

### Before Conditioning

| Stimulus | Response |
|----------|----------|
| UCS (food) | UCR (salivation) |
| NS (bell) | No relevant response |

### During Conditioning

| Pairing | Response |
|---------|----------|
| NS (bell) + UCS (food) | UCR (salivation) |

### After Conditioning

| Stimulus | Response |
|----------|----------|
| CS (bell) | CR (salivation) |

### Diagram

```
BEFORE:  UCS (Food) ──────→ UCR (Salivation)
         NS (Bell) ───────→ (No response)

DURING:  NS (Bell) + UCS (Food) → UCR (Salivation)
                     │
              Repeated pairings

AFTER:   CS (Bell) ──────→ CR (Salivation)
```

## 🔄 Classical Conditioning Phenomena

### Acquisition

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Acquisition** | Initial learning stage |
| **Timing** | CS should come slightly before UCS |
| **Best interval** | About 0.5 seconds |

### Extinction

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Extinction** | CR weakens when CS presented alone |
| **Process** | Bell without food → less salivation |
| **Note** | Response isn't erased, just suppressed |

### Spontaneous Recovery

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Spontaneous recovery** | CR reappears after rest period |
| **Shows** | Extinction doesn't erase learning |

### Timeline

```
Acquisition → Extinction → Rest → Spontaneous Recovery
    ↑            ↓          ↓           ↑
 Strong CR    Weak CR    Time       CR returns
                        passes      (weaker)
```

## 🔀 Generalization and Discrimination

### Stimulus Generalization

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Generalization** | Response to similar stimuli | Dog salivates to different bells |

### Stimulus Discrimination

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Discrimination** | Response only to specific CS | Dog only salivates to one specific bell |

---

## 🔧 Real-World Examples

### Classical Conditioning in Daily Life

| Example | UCS | UCR | CS | CR |
|---------|-----|-----|----|----|
| Food aversion | Bad food | Nausea | Restaurant | Nausea |
| Fear of dogs | Dog bite | Fear | Dogs | Fear |
| Advertising | Attractive model | Positive feelings | Product | Positive feelings |
| Dentist anxiety | Drill pain | Fear | Dentist office | Fear |

---

### Little Albert (Watson & Rayner, 1920)

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Subject | 11-month-old baby |
| UCS | Loud noise |
| UCR | Fear (crying) |
| NS → CS | White rat |
| CR | Fear of rat |
| Generalization | Fear of other furry things |

### Ethical Issues

- No informed consent
- No debriefing/desensitization
- Led to stronger ethical guidelines

---

## 🧠 Biological Factors

### Preparedness

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Biological preparedness** | Some associations form more easily |
| **Example** | Taste aversions after one pairing |
| **Evolutionary basis** | Survival advantage |

### Taste Aversion

| Feature | Details |

# 🐀 Operant Conditioning

## 🎯 What Is Operant Conditioning?

Learning through **consequences**! 📊

### Definition

Behavior is shaped by its consequences (reinforcement or punishment).

### Key Difference from Classical

| Classical | Operant |
|-----------|---------|
| Involuntary responses | Voluntary behaviors |
| Stimulus → Response | Behavior → Consequence |
| Pavlov | Skinner |

---

## 👥 Key Figures

### Edward Thorndike

| Contribution | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Puzzle box** | Cats learned to escape |
| **Law of Effect** | Rewarded behaviors repeated |

### B.F. Skinner

| Contribution | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Skinner box** | Controlled environment |
| **Reinforcement schedules** | Patterns of rewards |
| **Radical behaviorism** | Focus only on observable behavior |

---

## ⚖️ Reinforcement vs. Punishment

### The 2x2 Matrix

|  | **Add Something (+)** | **Remove Something (−)** |
|--|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Increase Behavior** | Positive Reinforcement | Negative Reinforcement |
| **Decrease Behavior** | Positive Punishment | Negative Punishment |

### Definitions

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Add pleasant → behavior ↑ | Treat for good grades |
| **Negative Reinforcement** | Remove unpleasant → behavior ↑ | Seatbelt stops beeping |
| **Positive Punishment** | Add unpleasant → behavior ↓ | Spanking |
| **Negative Punishment** | Remove pleasant → behavior ↓ | Take away phone |

### Memory Aid

- **Positive** = Add something (+)
- **Negative** = Remove something (−)
- **Reinforcement** = Behavior increases
- **Punishment** = Behavior decreases

---

## 📊 Types of Reinforcers

### Primary vs. Secondary

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Primary** | Naturally satisfying | Food, water, sleep |
| **Secondary (Conditioned)** | Learned value | Money, grades, praise |

### Immediate vs. Delayed

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Immediate** | Stronger effect |
| **Delayed** | Weaker effect |

---

## 📅 Schedules of Reinforcement

### Continuous vs. Partial

| Type | Definition | Effect |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Continuous** | Reinforce every response | Fast learning, fast extinction |
| **Partial (Intermittent)** | Reinforce some responses | Slower learning, slower extinction |

### Four Partial Schedules

| Schedule | Based On | Reinforced After |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Fixed Ratio (FR)** | Responses | Set number (every 5th) |
| **Variable Ratio (VR)** | Responses | Unpredictable number |
| **Fixed Interval (FI)** | Time | Set time period |
| **Variable Interval (VI)** | Time | Unpredictable time |

### Examples

| Schedule | Example | Response Pattern |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| FR | Piecework; buy 10 get 1 free | High rate; pause after reward |
| VR | Slot machines; sales calls | High, steady rate; hard to extinguish |
| FI | Weekly paycheck; checking oven | Slow start, faster near deadline |
| VI | Checking phone; fishing | Slow, steady rate |

### Response Patterns

```
High Rate, Steady: VR (slot machine)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

High Rate, Pause After Reward: FR (piecework)
  ━━━━━│━━━━│━━━━│━━━━

Low Rate, Steady: VI (fishing)
  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

Low Rate, Scalloped: FI (weekly pay)
  _/¯¯|_/¯¯|_/¯¯|_/¯¯
```

## 🎨 Shaping

### Definition

Reinforcing successive approximations to desired behavior.

### Example: Teaching a Pigeon to Turn

1. Reinforce any movement to the left
2. Reinforce only larger movements left
3. Reinforce only quarter turns
4. Reinforce only half turns
5. Reinforce only full turns

### Key Concept

Build complex behaviors step by step! 🔨

---

## ⚠️ Problems with Punishment

### Why Punishment Often Fails

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Suppresses, doesn't teach | Doesn't show what TO do |
| Creates fear/anxiety | Damages relationship |
| May increase aggression | Models aggressive behavior |
| Must be immediate/consistent | Hard to apply perfectly |
| Escape/avoidance | Learn to hide behavior |

### More Effective Alternatives

- Use reinforcement for desired behavior
- Remove reinforcement for unwanted behavior
- Explain why behavior is wrong
- Model appropriate behavior

---

## 🔗 Discriminative Stimuli

### Definition

A cue that signals when behavior will be reinforced.

| Example | Discriminative Stimulus |
|---------|------------------------|
| Dog sits when owner has treats | Seeing treats |
| Student raises hand in class | Teacher looking |
| Using phone in car | Parked vs. driving |

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Positive | Add (+) |
| Negative | Remove (−) |
| Reinforcement | Behavior increases |
| Punishment | Behavior decreases |
| VR | Most resistant to extinction |
| Shaping | Successive approximations |

# 👀 Observational Learning

## 🎯 What Is Observational Learning?

Learning by watching others! 👁️

### Definition

Also called **social learning** or **modeling** - learning by observing and imitating others.

### Key Figure: Albert Bandura

| Contribution | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Bobo doll experiment** | Children imitate aggressive models |
| **Social learning theory** | Observational learning principles |
| **Reciprocal determinism** | Person, behavior, environment interact |

---

## 🎈 The Bobo Doll Experiment

### Procedure

1. Children watched adult model
2. Model either aggressive or non-aggressive with Bobo doll
3. Children later played with Bobo doll

### Results

| Condition | Child Behavior |
|-----------|----------------|
| Aggressive model | Children hit, kicked Bobo |
| Non-aggressive model | Children played gently |
| No model | Little aggression |

### Conclusions

- Children learn through observation
- Behavior can be learned without direct reinforcement
- Models matter (especially similar, powerful, rewarded models)

---

## 📋 Four Steps of Observational Learning

### Bandura's ARRM Model

| Step | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Attention** | Notice the behavior | Watch tennis player serve |
| **Retention** | Remember the behavior | Mental image of serve |
| **Reproduction** | Physically perform | Try the serve yourself |
| **Motivation** | Want to repeat | See professional succeed |

### Memory Aid: ARRM

**A**ttention → **R**etention → **R**eproduction → **M**otivation

---

## 👥 Factors Affecting Modeling

### We're More Likely to Imitate Models Who Are:

| Factor | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Similar to us** | Age, gender, interests |
| **Successful/rewarded** | Their behavior "works" |
| **Powerful/high status** | Celebrities, parents |
| **Warm and nurturing** | Trusted, liked |

### Vicarious Learning

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Vicarious reinforcement** | See model rewarded | Copy their behavior |
| **Vicarious punishment** | See model punished | Avoid their behavior |

---

## 🔄 Reciprocal Determinism

### Three-Way Interaction

```
      Environment
         ↗ ↖
        ↙   ↘
    Person ←→ Behavior
```

- **Person** affects behavior and environment
- **Behavior** affects person and environment
- **Environment** affects person and behavior

### Example

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| Person | Shy personality |
| Behavior | Avoids parties |
| Environment | Fewer social invitations |

---

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: Explain how each of the following concepts applies to a student who studies hard for a test.

(a) Positive reinforcement
(b) Negative reinforcement
(c) Fixed interval schedule
(d) Observational learning

**Answer**:

(a) **Positive reinforcement**: When the student receives good grades or praise from parents and teachers after studying hard, this adds a pleasant consequence. The student is more likely to study hard in the future because the behavior was followed by something positive (praise, grades).

(b) **Negative reinforcement**: Studying hard might remove or avoid unpleasant stimuli. For example, studying removes anxiety about failing, or studying means parents stop nagging. The behavior increases because something unpleasant is removed or avoided.

(c) **Fixed interval schedule**: The student's studying might follow a fixed interval pattern around exam time. Tests occur at predictable intervals (e.g., every Friday), so the student studies more as the test approaches and less immediately after. This creates a "scalloped" pattern with increased effort near the scheduled reinforcement.

(d) **Observational learning**: The student may have learned study habits by watching successful peers, older siblings, or parents. By observing others who were rewarded for studying (got good grades, went to college), the student is motivated to imitate their study behavior. The student pays attention to study methods, remembers them, reproduces them, and is motivated by the observed success.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Negative reinforcement = punishment | Negative reinforcement INCREASES behavior |
| Confusing UCS and CS | UCS is natural; CS is learned |
| Thinking all learning is conscious | Latent learning happens without awareness |
| Confusing schedules | Ratio = responses; Interval = time |
