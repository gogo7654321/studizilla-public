| **Peters (1974)** | Cylindrical | Area | Shape (stretched) | Comparing country sizes | Continents look distorted |
| **Robinson (1963)** | Pseudo-cylindrical | Balance | All slightly | General reference | Not equal-area or conformal |
| **Winkel Tripel** | Modified azimuthal | Balance | All slightly | National Geographic standard | Compromise projection |
