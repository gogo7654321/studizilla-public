# 🔄 The Columbian Exchange

## 🌍 What Was It?

The **Columbian Exchange** was the massive transfer of plants, animals, diseases, people, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World! 🌎↔️🌍

### A Two-Way Exchange

```
    ← AMERICAS (New World) →
              ↕
    EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA
      ← (Old World) →
              ↕
    Plants, Animals, Diseases,
    People, Ideas, Culture
```

**Briefly explain ONE similarity between two different Native American societies before European contact.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Both the Pueblo peoples of the Southwest and the Iroquois of the Eastern Woodlands developed complex agricultural systems that included the Three Sisters crops (corn, beans, and squash). This agricultural base allowed both societies to establish permanent settlements and develop sophisticated social and political structures."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE effect of the Columbian Exchange on the Americas.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The introduction of Old World diseases, particularly smallpox, to the Americas resulted in catastrophic population decline among indigenous peoples.
