# 🔬 Research Methods in Psychology

## 📐 The Scientific Method

### Steps

1. **Observe** a phenomenon
2. **Form a hypothesis** (testable prediction)
3. **Design a study** to test hypothesis
4. **Collect data**
5. **Analyze results**
6. **Draw conclusions**
7. **Report findings** (peer review)
8. **Replicate** the study

---

## 📝 Types of Research

### Descriptive Research

**Goal**: Describe behavior (no cause-effect)

| Method | Description | Strength | Weakness |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Case study** | In-depth study of one person | Rich detail | Can't generalize |
| **Naturalistic observation** | Observe in natural setting | Real behavior | Observer bias |
| **Survey** | Self-report questionnaires | Large samples | Social desirability bias |

### Correlational Research

**Goal**: Find relationships between variables

| Correlation | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Positive (+)** | Both variables move same direction | More study → Higher grades |
| **Negative (−)** | Variables move opposite directions | More TV → Lower grades |
| **Zero (0)** | No relationship | Shoe size ↔ Intelligence |

### ⚠️ Correlation ≠ Causation!

```
A correlates with B could mean:
  A → B  (A causes B)
  B → A  (B causes A)
  C → A and B  (Third variable)
```

---

## 🧪 Experimental Research

### The Only Way to Show Cause and Effect!

### Key Components

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Independent Variable (IV)** | What experimenter manipulates |
| **Dependent Variable (DV)** | What is measured (depends on IV) |
| **Experimental group** | Receives the treatment |
| **Control group** | Does not receive treatment |
| **Random assignment** | Participants randomly placed in groups |

### Example Experiment

**Question**: Does caffeine improve memory?

| Component | In This Study |
|-----------|---------------|
| IV | Caffeine (present or absent) |
| DV | Memory test score |
| Experimental group | Drinks caffeinated coffee |
| Control group | Drinks decaf coffee |

---

## 🎯 Confounding Variables

### What Can Go Wrong

| Threat | Definition | Solution |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Confounding variable** | Uncontrolled factor that affects DV | Control all other variables |
| **Placebo effect** | Improvement from expectation alone | Use placebo control |
| **Experimenter bias** | Researcher influences results | Double-blind procedure |
| **Demand characteristics** | Participants guess hypothesis | Deception (ethical) |

### Double-Blind Procedure

Neither participants NOR researchers know who's in which group!

---

## 📊 Operational Definitions

### Making Abstract Concepts Measurable

| Abstract Concept | Operational Definition |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Aggression | Number of times child hits toy |
| Intelligence | Score on IQ test |

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Population** | Entire group you want to study |
| **Sample** | Subset that participates |
| **Generalizability** | Can results apply to population? |

---

## 📈 Experimental Design Types

### Between-Subjects Design

- Different people in each condition
- Needs random assignment

### Within-Subjects Design

- Same people in all conditions
- Each person is their own control

### Matched Pairs Design

- Participants paired on key variable
- One of each pair in each group

---

## 🔗 Validity and Reliability

### Research Quality

| Concept | Definition | Analogy |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Reliability** | Consistent results | Hitting same spot repeatedly |

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Experiments | Only method showing causation |
| IV | What you manipulate |
| DV | What you measure |
| Correlation ≠ Causation | Always true! |
| Random assignment | Key to experiments |

# 📊 Statistics in Psychology

## 📈 Descriptive Statistics

### Organizing and Summarizing Data

### Measures of Central Tendency

| Measure | Definition | When to Use |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Mean** | Average (sum ÷ n) | Most common; normal data |
| **Median** | Middle score | Skewed data; outliers |
| **Mode** | Most frequent score | Categorical data |

### Example

Scores: 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 25

- **Mean**: $(2+3+5+5+7+8+25) ÷ 7 = 7.86$
- **Median**: 5 (middle value)
- **Mode**: 5 (appears twice)

The outlier (25) pulls the mean up! Use median.

## 📉 Measures of Variability

### How Spread Out Is the Data?

| Measure | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Range** | Highest − Lowest |
| **Standard Deviation** | Average distance from mean |
| **Variance** | SD squared |

### Standard Deviation (SD)

```
Low SD = Data clustered near mean
High SD = Data spread out
```

| SD Value | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Small SD | Consistent; scores similar |
| Large SD | Variable; scores spread out |

---

## 📊 Normal Distribution

### Correlation Coefficient (r)

| Value | Strength |
|-------|----------|
| r = +1.0 | Perfect positive |
| r = +0.5 | Moderate positive |
| r = 0 | No relationship |
| r = −0.5 | Moderate negative |
| r = −1.0 | Perfect negative |

---

## ⚖️ Effect Size

### How Big Is the Difference?

Statistical significance ≠ Practical significance!

| Effect Size (Cohen's d) | Interpretation |
|------------------------|----------------|
| 0.2 | Small |
| 0.5 | Medium |
| 0.8 | Large |

## ✍️ Sample MC Questions

### Question 1

Which perspective would most likely focus on how the brain's neurotransmitters affect depression?

(A) Behavioral
(B) Psychoanalytic
(C) Biological
(D) Humanistic

**Answer: (C)** Biological perspective focuses on brain chemistry.

### Question 2

A researcher finds a correlation of r = −0.85 between hours of sleep and number of errors on a task. This indicates:

(A) More sleep causes fewer errors
(B) A weak negative relationship
(C) A strong negative relationship
(D) No relationship exists

**Answer: (C)** r = −0.85 is a strong negative correlation. (NOT causation!)

### Question 3

In an experiment on the effects of background music on studying, the dependent variable is:

(A) The type of music played
(B) The participants' study scores
(C) The time of day
(D) The experimenter's hypothesis

**Answer: (B)** DV is what you measure (study scores).

### Question 4

Which of the following is most important for establishing cause and effect?

(A) Large sample size
(B) Correlation analysis
(C) Random assignment
(D) Naturalistic observation

**Answer: (C)** Random assignment is essential for experiments.

---

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: A researcher wants to study whether caffeine improves reaction time.

(a) Identify the independent and dependent variables.

(b) Describe how the researcher could use random assignment.

(c) Explain why a double-blind procedure would be important.

(d) If the researcher found a correlation between caffeine consumption and reaction time, could causation be concluded? Explain.

**Answer**:

(a) **IV**: Caffeine (presence/absence or amount)
**DV**: Reaction time (measured in milliseconds)

(b) **Random assignment**: Participants would be randomly placed into either the caffeine group or control group. This could be done using a random number generator or drawing names from a hat. This ensures groups are equivalent before the study begins.

(c) **Double-blind**: Neither the participants nor researchers administering the test know who received caffeine. This prevents:
- Participants' expectations from affecting performance (placebo effect)
- Researchers' expectations from influencing how they record data (experimenter bias)

(d) **No causation from correlation**: Correlation only shows a relationship, not cause-and-effect. A third variable could explain both (e.g., motivation). Only a controlled experiment with random assignment can establish causation.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Saying correlation proves causation | Never! |
| Confusing IV and DV | IV = manipulate; DV = measure |
| Mixing up perspectives | Know key focus of each |
| Confusing random sampling and assignment | Sampling = who's in study; Assignment = which group |

---
