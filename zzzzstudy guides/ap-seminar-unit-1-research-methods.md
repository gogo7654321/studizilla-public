## ❓ 1.1 Developing Inquiry Questions

### What Makes a Good Question

```
STRONG INQUIRY QUESTIONS:

COMPLEX:
Not answered with simple yes/no
Requires investigation and analysis

RESEARCHABLE:
Can find evidence to explore
Sources exist to consult

DEBATABLE:
Multiple perspectives possible
Reasonable people disagree

SIGNIFICANT:
Matters to someone
Has real-world implications

FOCUSED:
Specific enough to explore deeply
Not too broad or too narrow
```

### Question Types

```
QUESTION PROGRESSION:

FACTUAL QUESTIONS:
- What is...?
- When did...?
- Who was...?
→ Answered with facts (starting point)

ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS:
- Why did...?
- How does...?
- What causes...?
→ Requires analysis (going deeper)

EVALUATIVE QUESTIONS:
- Should...?
- To what extent...?
- What is the best...?
→ Requires judgment (most complex)

MOVE FROM FACTUAL → ANALYTICAL → EVALUATIVE
```

### Refining Questions

```
QUESTION REFINEMENT PROCESS:

1. START BROAD
   "Climate change"
   
2. ADD SPECIFICITY
   "Effects of climate change"
   
3. NARROW FOCUS
   "Effects of climate change on agriculture"
   
4. ADD COMPLEXITY
   "How should farmers adapt to climate 
    change effects on crop yields?"
   
5. CONSIDER PERSPECTIVES
   "How do proposed climate adaptations 
    for agriculture balance economic 
    viability with environmental 
    sustainability?"
```

### Question Quality Checklist

```
EVALUATE YOUR QUESTION:

□ Is it open-ended (not yes/no)?
□ Does it require multiple sources?
□ Are there multiple perspectives?
□ Is it appropriately scoped?
□ Does it matter (significance)?
□ Can you research it?
□ Does it spark curiosity?
□ Is it original (not already settled)?

## 📝 1.4 Note-Taking and Organization

### Effective Note-Taking

```
NOTE-TAKING STRATEGIES:

FOR EACH SOURCE, RECORD:
1. Full citation information
2. Key arguments/claims
3. Relevant evidence
4. Useful quotations (with page numbers)
5. Your reactions/questions
6. Connections to other sources

ANNOTATION APPROACH:
- Summarize main points
- Note your reactions
- Ask questions
- Make connections
- Evaluate credibility
```

### Source Organization

```
ORGANIZING RESEARCH:

CITATION MANAGEMENT:
- Use citation software
  (Zotero, EasyBib, etc.)
- Track all sources
- Note where you found them
- Include access dates

THEMATIC ORGANIZATION:
- Group by topic
- Track perspectives
- Note connections
- Identify gaps

SYNTHESIS MATRIX:
Create a table:
| Theme    | Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Topic A  | Says X   | Says Y   | Says Z   |
| Topic B  | ...      | ...      | ...      |
```

### Avoiding Plagiarism

```
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:

MUST CITE:
- Direct quotations
- Paraphrased ideas
- Statistics and data
- Unique concepts
- Images and visuals

HOW TO AVOID PLAGIARISM:
1. Keep careful notes on sources
2. Quote exactly (with citation)
3. Paraphrase in your own words
4. Synthesize multiple sources
5. When in doubt, cite

PROPER PARAPHRASE:
- Use your own words
- Change sentence structure
- Still cite the source
- Don't just swap synonyms
```
