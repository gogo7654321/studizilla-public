## 💪 WHAT IS A FORCE?

### DEFINITION

**Force**: A push or pull on an object
- Vector quantity (has magnitude and direction)
- Units: Newtons (N) where $1 \text{ N} = 1 \text{ kg·m/s}^2$
- Causes acceleration (change in motion)
- Contact or non-contact (field forces)

### TYPES OF FORCES

| Force Type | Symbol | Contact? | Direction |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Gravity (Weight)** | $\vec{F}_g$ or $\vec{W}$ | No | Downward |
| **Normal Force** | $\vec{F}_N$ or $\vec{N}$ | Yes | Perpendicular to surface |
| **Friction** | $\vec{f}$ or $\vec{F}_f$ | Yes | Opposes motion |
| **Tension** | $\vec{T}$ or $\vec{F}_T$ | Yes | Along rope/string |
| **Applied Force** | $\vec{F}_A$ or $\vec{F}$ | Yes | Any direction |
| **Spring Force** | $\vec{F}_s$ | Yes | Toward equilibrium |
| **Air Resistance** | $\vec{F}_{air}$ or $\vec{D}$ | Yes | Opposes motion |

💡 **Remember**: Forces are vectors! Always include direction.

## 🎯 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW - THE LAW OF INERTIA

### STATEMENT

**"An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force."**

### KEY CONCEPTS

**Inertia**: Resistance to change in motion
- Mass is a measure of inertia
- More mass = more inertia = harder to accelerate

**Equilibrium**: $\sum \vec{F} = 0$ (net force = zero)
- Object at rest OR constant velocity
- Acceleration = 0

### EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS

| Scenario | Velocity | Acceleration | Net Force |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Static Equilibrium** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Dynamic Equilibrium** | Constant (≠ 0) | 0 | 0 |
| **Not in Equilibrium** | Changing | ≠ 0 | ≠ 0 |

### COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

❌ **Wrong**: "Objects need a force to keep moving"
✅ **Right**: Objects continue moving at constant velocity without any force

❌ **Wrong**: "Heavier objects fall faster"
✅ **Right**: All objects fall at the same rate (ignoring air resistance)

**Example:**
A book sliding on ice at constant velocity has **zero net force** acting on it (assuming frictionless surface). 🧊

---

## 🚀 NEWTON'S SECOND LAW - F = ma

### STATEMENT

**"The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass."**

Formula: $\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$

Or in component form:
- $\sum F_x = ma_x$
- $\sum F_y = ma_y$

### KEY INSIGHTS

1. **More force** → More acceleration
2. **More mass** → Less acceleration (for same force)
3. **Direction**: Force and acceleration are in the same direction
4. **Net force**: Sum of ALL forces on the object

### FORCE-MASS-ACCELERATION RELATIONSHIPS

| If this increases... | Then this happens... | Assuming... |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Force ↑ | Acceleration ↑ | Mass constant |
| Mass ↑ | Acceleration ↓ | Force constant |
| Both F & m ↑ (same %) | Acceleration same | Ratio unchanged |

### PROBLEM-SOLVING WITH F=ma

**Strategy:**
1. 🎨 Draw Free-Body Diagram
2. 📝 List all forces
3. ➕ Add forces as vectors (careful with signs!)
4. 🧮 Apply $\sum F = ma$
5. ✅ Solve for unknown

**Example:**
A 10 kg box is pushed with 50 N. If friction is 20 N, find acceleration.

$\sum F_x = F_{applied} - f = ma$
$50 - 20 = 10a$
$a = 3 \text{ m/s}^2$ ✓

---

## ⚖️ NEWTON'S THIRD LAW - ACTION-REACTION

### STATEMENT

**"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."**

Formula: $\vec{F}_{AB} = -\vec{F}_{BA}$

### KEY CHARACTERISTICS

✓ Forces come in pairs
✓ Equal in magnitude
✓ Opposite in direction
✓ Act on **different objects** (crucial!)
✓ Same type of force (both contact or both field)

### ACTION-REACTION PAIRS TABLE

| Action Force | Reaction Force |
|--------------|----------------|
| Earth pulls you down (weight) | You pull Earth up |
| You push wall → | ← Wall pushes you |
| Rocket pushes gas down ↓ | Gas pushes rocket up ↑ |
| Hammer hits nail → | Nail hits hammer ← |
| Foot kicks ball → | Ball kicks foot ← |

### COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Wrong**: Thinking action-reaction pairs act on the same object
✅ **Right**: They always act on **different** objects

❌ **Wrong**: Thinking they cancel out
✅ **Right**: They can't cancel because they act on different objects!

**Example:**
You push on a wall with 100 N.
- **Action**: You push wall with 100 N →
- **Reaction**: Wall pushes you with 100 N ←

You don't move through the wall because friction with the ground balances the wall's push on you! 🧱

## 🎨 FREE-BODY DIAGRAMS (FBDs)

### WHAT ARE FBDs?

**Free-Body Diagram**: Simplified sketch showing ALL forces acting on ONE object
- Most important skill in dynamics!
- Draw object as a dot or box
- Draw force vectors as arrows
- Label each force

### FBD CONSTRUCTION STEPS

1. 🎯 **Isolate** the object of interest
2. ⭕ **Draw** object as a point or simple shape
3. ➡️ **Add force arrows** from center of object
4. 🏷️ **Label** each force clearly
5. 📏 **Choose** coordinate system
6. ✅ **Check** for completeness

### COMMON SCENARIOS

#### Object on Horizontal Surface

```
      ↑ N (Normal Force)
      |
    [BOX]
      |
      ↓ Fg (Weight)
```

Forces: $\vec{N}$ (up), $\vec{F}_g$ (down)

#### Object Being Pushed

```
    ↑ N
    |
→F [BOX]
    |
    ↓ Fg
```

Forces: $\vec{F}$ (applied), $\vec{N}$ (up), $\vec{F}_g$ (down), $\vec{f}$ (friction, opposite to motion)

#### Object on Incline

```
      ↑ N (perpendicular to surface)
     /|
    / |
   /[BOX]
  /   |
 /    ↓ Fg (straight down)
```

Forces: $\vec{N}$ (⟂ to incline), $\vec{F}_g$ (down), friction (up or down incline)

### FBD TIPS

✓ **Only include forces ON the object** (not forces BY the object)
✓ **Draw forces from center** of object
✓ **Length of arrow** ∝ magnitude (optional but helpful)
✓ **All forces must touch** the object
✓ **Weight always points** straight down
✓ **Normal force** perpendicular to surface

## 📊 COMMON FORCES IN DETAIL

### 1. WEIGHT (GRAVITATIONAL FORCE)

Formula: $F_g = mg$

Where:
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $g = 9.8$ m/s² (or 10 m/s² for simplicity)

- **Always points DOWN** toward center of Earth
- **Mass vs Weight**: Mass is intrinsic; weight depends on gravity

| Mass (kg) | Weight on Earth (N) | Weight on Moon (N) |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 10 | 98 | 16 |
| 50 | 490 | 82 |
| 70 | 686 | 115 |

💡 Moon gravity ≈ 1/6 of Earth's gravity

### 2. NORMAL FORCE

- **Perpendicular** (⟂) to contact surface
- **Reaction** to object pressing on surface
- **NOT always equal** to weight!

| Scenario | Normal Force |
|----------|--------------|
| Horizontal surface (no vertical forces) | $N = mg$ |
| Pushed down by force F | $N = mg + F$ |
| Pulled up by force F | $N = mg - F$ |
| On incline (angle θ) | $N = mg\cos\theta$ |
| Elevator accelerating up (+a) | $N = m(g + a)$ |
| Elevator accelerating down (-a) | $N = m(g - a)$ |

**Example:**
70 kg person in elevator accelerating up at 2 m/s²:
$N = m(g + a) = 70(10 + 2) = 840$ N (feels heavier!) ⬆️

### 3. TENSION

- Force transmitted through rope, cable, or string
- **Pulls** objects together (never pushes!)
- Same throughout rope if rope is massless
- Direction: **along** the rope

**Multiple Objects:**
If rope connects objects A and B:
- Tension pulls A toward B
- Tension pulls B toward A
- Both tensions have same magnitude (N3L)

### 4. APPLIED FORCE

- External force you apply
- Can be any direction
- Often given in problems
- Must break into components if angled

---

## 🔥 FRICTION

### TYPES OF FRICTION

| Type | Symbol | When? | Magnitude |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Static Friction** | $f_s$ | Object at rest | $0 \leq f_s \leq \mu_s N$ |
| **Kinetic Friction** | $f_k$ | Object sliding | $f_k = \mu_k N$ |

### STATIC FRICTION

Formula: $f_s \leq \mu_s N$

- Prevents sliding
- **Variable**: Adjusts to applied force
- **Maximum**: $f_{s,max} = \mu_s N$
- **Direction**: Opposes **potential** motion

**Example:**
You push a box with 10 N, it doesn't move. Friction = 10 N (not maximum!)
You push with 50 N, it starts moving. Max static friction was reached! 📦

### KINETIC FRICTION

Formula: $f_k = \mu_k N$

- Acts during sliding
- **Constant** (for given surfaces)
- $\mu_k < \mu_s$ (always!)
- **Direction**: Opposes **actual** motion

### COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION (μ)

| Surface Pair | $\mu_s$ | $\mu_k$ |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Steel on steel | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| Rubber on dry concrete | 1.0 | 0.7 |
| Wood on wood | 0.5 | 0.3 |
| Ice on ice | 0.1 | 0.03 |
| Teflon on Teflon | 0.04 | 0.04 |

💡 **Friction is independent of surface area!** (As long as N is the same)

### FRICTION PROBLEM-SOLVING

**To find if object moves:**
1. Calculate $f_{s,max} = \mu_s N$
2. Compare to applied force
3. If $F_{applied} > f_{s,max}$: object moves, use $f_k = \mu_k N$
4. If $F_{applied} < f_{s,max}$: object doesn't move, $f_s = F_{applied}$

**Example:**
A 5 kg box on the ground. $\mu_s = 0.4$, $\mu_k = 0.3$. Push with 25 N. Does it move?

$N = mg = 5(10) = 50$ N
$f_{s,max} = 0.4(50) = 20$ N
$F_{applied} = 25$ N > 20 N → **YES, it moves!** ✓
$f_k = 0.3(50) = 15$ N (friction while moving)

---

## ⛰️ INCLINED PLANES

### COORDINATE SYSTEM

**Key Strategy**: Tilt your axes!
- **x-axis**: Parallel to incline (∥)
- **y-axis**: Perpendicular to incline (⟂)

### FORCE COMPONENTS

For angle $\theta$ above horizontal:

**Weight components:**
- Parallel to incline: $F_{g,\parallel} = mg\sin\theta$ (down the slope)
- Perpendicular: $F_{g,\perp} = mg\cos\theta$ (into the slope)

**Normal force:**
- $N = mg\cos\theta$ (if no other vertical forces)

**Friction:**
- $f = \mu N = \mu mg\cos\theta$ (up or down slope)

### INCLINE FORMULAS

| Scenario | Acceleration |
|----------|--------------|
| **Frictionless, sliding down** | $a = g\sin\theta$ |
| **With friction, sliding down** | $a = g(\sin\theta - \mu_k\cos\theta)$ |
| **Just starting to slide** | $\tan\theta = \mu_s$ |

### INCLINE ANGLES

| Angle | $\sin\theta$ | $\cos\theta$ | Common Name |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 30° | 0.5 | 0.866 | Common in problems |
| 37° | 0.6 | 0.8 | 3-4-5 triangle |
| 45° | 0.707 | 0.707 | Equal components |
| 53° | 0.8 | 0.6 | 3-4-5 triangle |

💡 **Remember**: 37° and 53° are complementary and use 3-4-5 triangle!

**Example:**
5 kg box on 30° frictionless incline. Find acceleration.

$a = g\sin\theta = 10 \sin(30°) = 10(0.5) = 5$ m/s² ✓

---

## 🔗 MULTIPLE OBJECTS & SYSTEMS

### CONNECTED OBJECTS

**Strategy:**
1. Draw FBD for **each** object separately
2. Write F=ma for **each** object
3. Identify constraint (like same acceleration)
4. Combine equations and solve

### ATWOOD MACHINE

Two masses connected by rope over pulley:

**Key equations:**
- $m_1g - T = m_1a$ (heavier mass)
- $T - m_2g = m_2a$ (lighter mass)
- Same $|a|$ for both (constraint)

**Solution:**
$a = \frac{(m_1 - m_2)g}{m_1 + m_2}$

$T = \frac{2m_1m_2g}{m_1 + m_2}$

### SYSTEMS APPROACH

**Internal vs External Forces:**
- **Internal**: Forces between objects in system (cancel in N3L pairs)
- **External**: Forces from outside system (cause acceleration)

**Formula:** $F_{external} = (m_{total})a_{system}$

**Example:**
Two boxes pushed together (5 kg and 3 kg) with 40 N force.

System approach:
$a = \frac{F}{m_{total}} = \frac{40}{5+3} = 5$ m/s² ✓

Force between boxes: Focus on 3 kg block:
$F_{on\,3kg} = m_2 a = 3(5) = 15$ N ✓

---

## 🧮 PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES

### GENERAL APPROACH

1. **📖 Read carefully**: What's given? What's unknown?
2. **🎨 Draw FBD**: For each object!
3. **📍 Choose coordinates**: Usually x-horizontal, y-vertical (or ∥ and ⟂ for inclines)
4. **✍️ Write F=ma**: For each direction
5. **➕ Sum forces**: $\sum F_x = ma_x$ and $\sum F_y = ma_y$
6. **🔗 Identify constraints**: Same acceleration? Connected by rope?
7. **🧮 Solve algebra**: Isolate unknown
8. **✅ Check**: Units? Reasonable? Sign?

### TIPS FOR SUCCESS

✓ **Always start with FBD** - this is 80% of the problem!
✓ **Pay attention to signs** - choose + direction and stick with it
✓ **Normal force ≠ weight** (usually)
✓ **Friction opposes motion** (or potential motion)
✓ **Tension same throughout** massless rope
✓ **Action-reaction forces** on different objects

## 💡 WORKED EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Horizontal Surface with Friction

**Problem:** A 20 kg box is pushed with 100 N. If $\mu_k = 0.3$, find acceleration.

**Solution:**
FBD: $F_{applied}$ (right), $f_k$ (left), $N$ (up), $F_g$ (down)

Vertical: $N = mg = 20(10) = 200$ N
Friction: $f_k = \mu_k N = 0.3(200) = 60$ N

Horizontal: $\sum F_x = ma$
$100 - 60 = 20a$
$a = 2$ m/s² ✓

### Example 2: Incline

**Problem:** 8 kg block on 37° incline, $\mu_k = 0.25$. Find acceleration down incline.

**Solution:**
$F_{g,\parallel} = mg\sin\theta = 8(10)(0.6) = 48$ N
$N = mg\cos\theta = 8(10)(0.8) = 64$ N
$f_k = \mu_k N = 0.25(64) = 16$ N

$\sum F_{\parallel} = ma$
$48 - 16 = 8a$
$a = 4$ m/s² ✓

### Example 3: Two Blocks Connected

**Problem:** 4 kg and 6 kg blocks connected by rope. 4 kg pulled right with 50 N on frictionless surface. Find tension.

**Solution:**
System: $a = \frac{F}{m_{total}} = \frac{50}{10} = 5$ m/s²

For 6 kg block: $T = ma = 6(5) = 30$ N ✓

(Tension must accelerate the 6 kg block at 5 m/s²)

## 🧠 KEY FORMULAS SUMMARY

### Newton's Laws
- **1st Law**: $\sum \vec{F} = 0$ → $a = 0$ (equilibrium)
- **2nd Law**: $\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$
- **3rd Law**: $\vec{F}_{AB} = -\vec{F}_{BA}$

### Common Forces
- **Weight**: $F_g = mg$
- **Normal (horizontal)**: $N = mg$ (if no other vertical forces)
- **Static Friction**: $f_s \leq \mu_s N$ (max: $f_{s,max} = \mu_s N$)
- **Kinetic Friction**: $f_k = \mu_k N$

### Inclined Planes
- **Parallel component**: $F_{g,\parallel} = mg\sin\theta$
- **Perpendicular component**: $F_{g,\perp} = mg\cos\theta$
- **Normal force**: $N = mg\cos\theta$
- **Frictionless acceleration**: $a = g\sin\theta$

---

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Forgetting to draw FBD**
✅ Always draw FBD first - it organizes your thinking!

❌ **Including forces not acting on the object**
✅ Only forces ON the object go in FBD

❌ **Setting normal force equal to weight in all situations**
✅ $N = mg$ only on horizontal surface with no other vertical forces

❌ **Using max static friction when object doesn't move**
✅ Static friction equals applied force (up to maximum)

❌ **Wrong direction for friction**
✅ Friction opposes motion (or potential motion)

❌ **Forgetting tension pulls both directions**
✅ Tension is action-reaction pair (N3L)

❌ **Not breaking forces into components on inclines**
✅ Use $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$ to find components

❌ **Mixing up static and kinetic friction**
✅ Static = not moving; Kinetic = sliding
