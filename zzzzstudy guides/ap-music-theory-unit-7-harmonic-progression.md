# 🎹 Unit 7: Harmonic Progression

## 📚 Unit Overview

Unit 7 explores chromatic harmony including secondary dominants, modulation techniques, borrowed chords, and the Neapolitan and augmented sixth chords.

## 🎵 7.1 Secondary Dominants

### Concept of Tonicization

```
TONICIZATION:
Temporarily treating a chord as tonic
Without actually changing key

SECONDARY DOMINANT:
V of a chord other than I
"Borrows" dominant function

EXAMPLE (C major):
D major chord (D-F♯-A)
= V of G (V/V)
= "Five of Five"

Resolves: D → G (temporary V→I)
```

### Common Secondary Dominants

```
SECONDARY DOMINANTS IN MAJOR:

V/ii   A major → D minor
       A-C♯-E → D-F-A

V/iii  B major → E minor
       B-D♯-F♯ → E-G-B

V/IV   C major → F major
       C-E-G → F-A-C (actually I!)

V/V    D major → G major
       D-F♯-A → G-B-D

V/vi   E major → A minor
       E-G♯-B → A-C-E

Most common: V/V and V/vi
```

### Writing Secondary Dominants

```
TO FIND V/X:

1. Identify target chord (X)
2. Build major triad on its 5th
3. Add 7th if desired (V7/X)

EXAMPLE: V7/vi in C major
Target: A minor (vi)
Fifth of A = E
Build: E-G♯-B-D
Result: E7 = V7/vi
```

### Secondary Dominant Resolution

```
RESOLUTION PRINCIPLES:

1. RAISED NOTES GO UP
   F♯ in V/V → G (leading tone)
   
2. 7TH GOES DOWN
   D in V7/V → C (7th resolves)

3. ROOT MOVES BY 5TH
   D → G (authentic cadence)

V/V → V → I (common sequence)
"Five of five to five to one"
```

---

## 🔄 7.2 Secondary Leading Tone Chords

### viio/X Chords

```
SECONDARY LEADING TONE:
vii° of a chord other than I

viio/V in C major:
F♯ diminished = F♯-A-C
Resolves to G (V)

viio7/V:
F♯-A-C-E♭ (fully diminished)
Resolves to G

FUNCTION:
Same as V/X but without root
Smoother voice leading sometimes
```

### Half-Diminished vs. Fully Diminished

```
IN MAJOR KEYS:
viiø7/X (half-diminished)
Uses natural 6th of target

IN MINOR KEYS (or for color):
viio7/X (fully diminished)
Uses lowered 6th of target

EXAMPLE:
viiø7/V in C: F♯-A-C-E
viio7/V in C: F♯-A-C-E♭
```

## 🌐 7.3 Modulation

### Types of Modulation

```
MODULATION:
Actual key change (not just tonicization)

TYPES:

1. PIVOT CHORD MODULATION
   Common chord in both keys
   Smooth transition

2. DIRECT MODULATION
   Abrupt key change
   No pivot chord

3. SEQUENTIAL MODULATION
   Pattern leads to new key
   
4. CHROMATIC MODULATION
   Chromatic voice leading
   Enharmonic reinterpretation
```

### Pivot Chord Modulation

```
PIVOT CHORD:
Chord functioning in both keys

C MAJOR → G MAJOR:

C major:  I   vi   ii    V   I
          C   Am   Dm    G   C
                    ↓
G major:       [ii = v]
               Dm is ii in C
               Dm is v in G

Analysis:
C: I - vi - ii  |
G:      [v] - I - V - I
         pivot
```

### Common Modulation Targets

```
CLOSELY RELATED KEYS:
Differ by one accidental

FROM MAJOR KEY:
- Dominant (up P5): C → G
- Subdominant (up P4): C → F
- Relative minor (down m3): C → Am
- ii minor: C → Dm
- iii minor: C → Em

FROM MINOR KEY:
- Relative major (up m3): Am → C
- Dominant (with raised 7): Am → Em
- Subdominant: Am → Dm
- III major: Am → C
- VII major: Am → G
```

### Recognizing Modulation

```
SIGNS OF MODULATION:

1. NEW ACCIDENTALS
   Consistent sharps or flats
   Not just chromatic passing
   
2. CADENCE IN NEW KEY
   PAC confirms new tonic
   
3. NEW LEADING TONE
   7th of new key appears
   
4. PIVOT POINT
   Chord that could be in either key

LENGTH MATTERS:
Brief = Tonicization
Extended = Modulation
```

## 🎭 7.4 Mode Mixture (Borrowed Chords)

### Concept of Borrowing

```
MODE MIXTURE:
Borrowing chords from parallel mode

C MAJOR borrows from C MINOR:
- ♭III (E♭ major)
- iv (F minor)
- ♭VI (A♭ major)
- ♭VII (B♭ major)
- ii° (D diminished)

These add "minor color" to major key
```

### Common Borrowed Chords

```
BORROWED CHORDS IN MAJOR:

♭VI:
A♭ major in C major
Very common in rock/pop
"Epic" sound

iv:
F minor in C major
More somber subdominant
Often before V

♭VII:
B♭ major in C major
Rock/pop flavor
"Mixolydian" sound

♭III:
E♭ major in C major
Dramatic contrast
Common in film music
```

### Picardy Third

```
PICARDY THIRD:
Major I at end of minor piece

A MINOR ending:
Expected: Am (A-C-E)
Picardy: A major (A-C♯-E)

Raises the 3rd for final chord
Creates bright ending
Common in Baroque music

Opposite: "Minor plagal"
Major piece ends with iv → I
```

## ⚡ 7.5 The Neapolitan Chord

### Neapolitan Sixth (♭II6)

```
NEAPOLITAN (N or ♭II6):
Major triad on lowered 2nd degree
Almost always in first inversion

In A MINOR:
♭II = B♭ major (B♭-D-F)
♭II6 = B♭ major, 1st inversion
      D in bass (D-F-B♭)

WHY "SIXTH"?
First inversion = 6 chord
Neapolitan almost always inverted
```

### Neapolitan Function

```
NEAPOLITAN USAGE:

FUNCTION: Subdominant
Approaches dominant like iv

TYPICAL PROGRESSION:
i → N6 → V → i
   or
i → N6 → viio7/V → V → i

VOICE LEADING:
♭2 (B♭) → 7 (G♯) or → 5 (E)
4 (D) → 5 (E) in bass

DRAMATIC EFFECT:
Intense, dark, emotional
Common in minor keys
```

---

## 🎵 7.6 Augmented Sixth Chords

### Three Types

```
AUGMENTED SIXTH CHORDS:
Named for nationalities (historically)

Built on ♭6 of key
Contains augmented 6th interval
Resolves to V

In C major/minor:
♭6 = A♭

ITALIAN (It+6):
A♭ - C - F♯
(♭6, 1, ♯4)

FRENCH (Fr+6):
A♭ - C - D - F♯
(♭6, 1, 2, ♯4)

GERMAN (Gr+6):
A♭ - C - E♭ - F♯
(♭6, 1, ♭3, ♯4)
```

### Recognizing Aug6 Chords

```
IDENTIFYING AUGMENTED 6TH:

1. LOOK FOR A6 INTERVAL
   ♭6 to ♯4 = augmented 6th
   
2. CHECK BASS NOTE
   ♭6 in bass (A♭ in C)
   
3. COUNT PITCHES
   3 notes = Italian
   4 notes with 2 = French
   4 notes with ♭3 = German

ENHARMONIC NOTE:
German +6 sounds like V7/♭II
A♭-C-E♭-F♯ = A♭-C-E♭-G♭
Same sound, different function!
```

### Aug6 Resolution

```
RESOLUTION TO V:

VOICE LEADING:
♭6 (A♭) → 5 (G) [down half step]
♯4 (F♯) → 5 (G) [up half step]
1 (C) → holds or → 7 (B)

The A6 interval EXPANDS to octave!
A♭ → G ← F♯
     (octave G)

GERMAN +6 ISSUE:
E♭ → D would create parallel 5ths
Solution: V → I6/4 → V first
        (Cadential 6/4)
```

## 📊 7.7 Complete Chromatic Analysis

### Analysis Process

```
CHROMATIC HARMONY ANALYSIS:

1. IDENTIFY KEY
   Key signature + accidentals

2. FIND DIATONIC FRAMEWORK
   Label clear diatonic chords

3. IDENTIFY SECONDARY DOMINANTS
   Look for V/X patterns
   Check resolution

4. CHECK FOR BORROWED CHORDS
   Parallel mode mixture?

5. SPOT SPECIAL CHORDS
   Neapolitan (♭II6)
   Augmented 6th (+6)

6. NOTE MODULATIONS
   Find pivot chords
   New key confirmation
```

### Roman Numeral Notation

```
CHROMATIC ANALYSIS SYMBOLS:

Secondary dominants: V/X, V7/X, viio/X
   Example: V7/vi, viio7/V

Borrowed chords: Use ♭ or ♯
   Example: ♭VI, ♭VII, iv

Neapolitan: N6 or ♭II6

Augmented 6th: It+6, Fr+6, Gr+6

Modulation: Show pivot bracket
   Old key: [chord]
   New key: [chord]
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

```
1. SECONDARY DOMINANTS TONICIZE
   - V/X creates temporary tonic
   - Raised notes act as leading tones
   - Resolve like V → I

2. MODULATION CHANGES KEY
   - Pivot chord smoothest
   - Closely related keys easiest
   - Confirm with cadence

3. BORROWED CHORDS ADD COLOR
   - From parallel mode
   - ♭VI, ♭VII, iv common
   - Mix major/minor qualities

4. NEAPOLITAN IS SPECIAL
   - ♭II6 (first inversion)
   - Subdominant function
   - Dramatic, dark color

5. AUG6 CHORDS EXPAND TO V
   - Three types (It, Fr, Gr)
   - ♭6 and ♯4 expand outward
   - Approach dominant intensely
```

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
SECONDARY DOMINANT ID:

1. LOOK FOR ACCIDENTALS
   Raised notes = leading tones
   
2. CHECK WHAT FOLLOWS
   Does it resolve to diatonic chord?
   
3. NAME IT
   V/[chord it resolves to]

AUGMENTED 6TH TRICKS:

Count the unique pitches:
3 = Italian
4 with M2 = French  
4 with m3 = German

GERMAN +6 sounds like Dom7
but functions differently!

MODULATION vs. TONICIZATION:
Brief (1-2 chords) = tonicization
Extended + cadence = modulation
```
