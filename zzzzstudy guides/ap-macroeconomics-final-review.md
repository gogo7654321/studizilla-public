## 🔑 Essential Formulas

### GDP and National Income

| Formula | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **GDP (Expenditure)** | GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) |
| **GDP (Income)** | GDP = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit |
| **Nominal GDP** | Current prices × Current quantities |
| **Real GDP** | Base year prices × Current quantities |
| **GDP Deflator** | (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100 |
| **Real GDP Growth Rate** | [(Real GDP₂ - Real GDP₁) / Real GDP₁] × 100 |
| **Per Capita GDP** | GDP / Population |

### Unemployment Calculations

| Formula | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **Unemployment Rate** | (Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100 |
| **Labor Force** | Employed + Unemployed |
| **Labor Force Participation Rate** | (Labor Force / Working Age Pop.) × 100 |
| **Employment Rate** | (Employed / Working Age Pop.) × 100 |

### Inflation and Price Indices

| Formula | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **Inflation Rate** | [(CPI₂ - CPI₁) / CPI₁] × 100 |
| **CPI** | (Cost of Basket Today / Cost of Basket Base Year) × 100 |
| **Real Interest Rate** | Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate |
| **Real Wage** | Nominal Wage / Price Level |

### Multipliers (CRITICAL!)

| Multiplier | Formula | Explanation |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Spending Multiplier** | 1 / (1 - MPC) or 1 / MPS | Change in GDP from $1 spending |
| **Tax Multiplier** | -MPC / (1 - MPC) or -MPC / MPS | Change in GDP from $1 tax change |
| **Balanced Budget Multiplier** | Always = 1 | Equal ΔG and ΔT |
| **Money Multiplier** | 1 / Reserve Ratio | Deposit expansion |

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Spending multiplier > Tax multiplier (in absolute value)

### Multiplier Examples

If MPC = 0.8:
- MPS = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- Spending Multiplier = 1/0.2 = **5**
- Tax Multiplier = -0.8/0.2 = **-4**

If Reserve Ratio = 0.1:
- Money Multiplier = 1/0.1 = **10**
- $1,000 deposit creates up to $10,000 in money supply

## 🏦 Monetary Policy

### The Federal Reserve Tools

| Tool | Expansionary | Contractionary |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Open Market Operations** | Buy bonds | Sell bonds |
| **Reserve Requirement** | Lower RR | Raise RR |
| **Discount Rate** | Lower rate | Raise rate |
| **Federal Funds Rate Target** | Lower target | Raise target |
| **Interest on Reserves** | Lower IOR | Raise IOR |

### Expansionary Monetary Policy Chain

```
Fed buys bonds → Bank reserves ↑ → Money supply ↑ → 
Interest rates ↓ → Investment ↑ → AD ↑ → 
Real GDP ↑ and Price Level ↑
```

### Contractionary Monetary Policy Chain

```
Fed sells bonds → Bank reserves ↓ → Money supply ↓ → 
Interest rates ↑ → Investment ↓ → AD ↓ → 
Real GDP ↓ and Price Level ↓
```

### Monetary Policy Limitations

1. **Liquidity Trap**: Interest rates at zero, can't go lower
2. **Time Lags**: Recognition, implementation, impact lags
3. **Bank Behavior**: Banks may not lend excess reserves
4. **Global Factors**: International capital flows

---

## 🏛️ Fiscal Policy

### Fiscal Policy Tools

| Tool | Expansionary | Contractionary |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Government Spending** | Increase G | Decrease G |
| **Taxes** | Decrease T | Increase T |
| **Transfer Payments** | Increase transfers | Decrease transfers |

### Expansionary Fiscal Policy Chain

```
Increase G or Decrease T → Disposable income ↑ → 
Consumption ↑ → AD ↑ → Real GDP ↑ and Price Level ↑
```

### Contractionary Fiscal Policy Chain

```
Decrease G or Increase T → Disposable income ↓ → 
Consumption ↓ → AD ↓ → Real GDP ↓ and Price Level ↓
```

### Crowding Out Effect

```
Expansionary Fiscal Policy:

G ↑ → Budget Deficit ↑ → Government borrowing ↑ →
Demand for loanable funds ↑ → Real interest rates ↑ →
Private investment ↓ → Partially offsets AD increase

⚠️ Complete crowding out: No net change in AD
⚠️ Partial crowding out: AD still increases, but less
```

### Automatic Stabilizers

- Progressive income taxes
- Unemployment insurance
- Welfare programs
- SNAP/Food stamps

> 💡 **Key**: Automatic stabilizers reduce GDP fluctuations WITHOUT legislation

---

## 🌐 International Economics

### Balance of Payments

| Account | Components |
|---------|------------|
| **Current Account** | Trade balance, income, transfers |
| **Capital Account** | Minor financial transfers |
| **Financial Account** | Investment flows, official reserves |

> **Key Identity**: Current Account + Capital Account + Financial Account = 0

### Exchange Rate Effects

**Appreciation of Dollar**:
- US exports ↓ (more expensive abroad)
- US imports ↑ (cheaper for Americans)
- Net exports ↓
- AD ↓

**Depreciation of Dollar**:
- US exports ↑ (cheaper abroad)
- US imports ↓ (more expensive for Americans)
- Net exports ↑
- AD ↑

### Interest Rate Differentials

```
US Interest Rates ↑ →
Foreign investment in US ↑ →
Demand for dollars ↑ →
Dollar appreciates →
US Net Exports ↓
```

### Twin Deficits

```
Budget Deficit ↑ → Government borrowing ↑ →
Real interest rates ↑ → Capital inflows ↑ →
Dollar appreciates → Net exports ↓ →
Trade Deficit ↑
```

| Consumer expectations | Retail sales | Prime rate |
| New orders | Employment | Labor cost per unit |
| Money supply (M2) | Personal income | Consumer debt |
| Yield curve | Manufacturing sales | Business loans |

### Types of Unemployment

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Frictional** | Searching between jobs | Recent graduate job hunting |
| **Structural** | Skills mismatch | Coal miners in tech economy |
| **Cyclical** | Due to recession | Layoffs during downturn |
| **Seasonal** | Regular seasonal patterns | Ski instructor in summer |

> **Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)** = Frictional + Structural

### Okun's Law

For every 1% unemployment above NRU, real GDP is approximately 2% below potential GDP.

## ✏️ FRQ Strategies

### Common FRQ Question Types

1. **AD-AS Analysis**: Draw graph, show shifts, identify changes
2. **Monetary Policy Chain**: Fed action → money market → AD-AS
3. **Fiscal Policy with Crowding Out**: Government action → loanable funds → investment
4. **Open Economy**: Policy → interest rates → FOREX → trade
5. **Phillips Curve Connection**: AD-AS changes → unemployment/inflation trade-off

### FRQ Answer Template

**For AD-AS Questions**:
1. Draw correctly labeled AD-AS graph
2. Show initial equilibrium (PL₁, Y₁)
3. Identify which curve shifts and direction
4. Show new equilibrium (PL₂, Y₂)
5. State what happens to price level and real GDP

**For Policy Chain Questions**:
1. State the policy action
2. Show immediate market effect (money market or loanable funds)
3. Identify intermediate variable change (interest rate)
4. Connect to aggregate demand
5. Show final AD-AS outcome

### Graph Labeling Checklist

- [ ] Axes labeled correctly (Price Level, Real GDP)
- [ ] Curves labeled (AD, SRAS, LRAS)
- [ ] Equilibrium points marked and labeled
- [ ] Shift direction shown with arrows
- [ ] New curves labeled (AD₂, SRAS₂)
- [ ] Changes in variables clearly indicated

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Graph Errors

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| LRAS slopes | LRAS is always VERTICAL |
| AD curves up | AD slopes DOWNWARD |
| Missing labels | Always label axes, curves, equilibrium |
| Wrong direction | Double-check shift direction |
| Confusing shifts | Movement ALONG vs. SHIFT of curve |

### Calculation Errors

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Forgetting MPC + MPS = 1 | Always verify |
| Tax multiplier positive | Tax multiplier is NEGATIVE |
| Wrong multiplier formula | Spending: 1/(1-MPC), Tax: -MPC/(1-MPC) |
| Ignoring reserve ratio | Check if complete/partial multiplication |

### Conceptual Errors

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Fed controls fiscal policy | Fed = monetary, Congress = fiscal |
| Money supply vertical in loanable funds | Money supply is in money market |
| Phillips Curve = AD-AS | They're related but different graphs |
| Appreciation helps exports | Appreciation HURTS exports |
| Real vs. Nominal confusion | Real = adjusted for inflation |

### Policy Chain Errors

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Skipping intermediate steps | Show complete cause-effect chain |
| Forgetting crowding out | Include when fiscal policy expands deficit |
| Ignoring exchange rate effects | Consider international impact |
| Mixing up policy tools | Match tool to correct institution |

## 📝 Quick Reference: Policy Effects Summary

### Short-Run Effects of Expansionary Policy

| Variable | Monetary | Fiscal |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Interest Rate | ↓ (initially) | ↑ (crowding out) |
| Investment | ↑ | ↓ or mixed |
| Real GDP | ↑ | ↑ |
| Price Level | ↑ | ↑ |
| Unemployment | ↓ | ↓ |
| Dollar Value | ↓ | ↑ |
| Net Exports | ↑ | ↓ |

### Long-Run Adjustments

In the long run:
- Economy returns to full employment (LRAS)
- Price level fully adjusts
- Real variables return to natural rates
- Monetary policy affects only nominal variables (money neutrality)

## 🧮 Practice Calculations

### Example 1: Multiplier Effect

**Given**: MPC = 0.75, Government increases spending by $100 billion

**Solution**:
- Spending Multiplier = 1/(1-0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4
- ΔReal GDP = 4 × $100B = **$400 billion increase**

### Example 2: Tax Multiplier

**Given**: MPC = 0.8, Taxes cut by $50 billion

**Solution**:
- Tax Multiplier = -0.8/(1-0.8) = -0.8/0.2 = -4
- ΔReal GDP = -4 × (-$50B) = **$200 billion increase**

### Example 3: Money Multiplier

**Given**: Reserve Ratio = 20%, Initial deposit = $1,000

**Solution**:
- Money Multiplier = 1/0.20 = 5
- Maximum money creation = 5 × $1,000 = **$5,000**
- Maximum new loans = $5,000 - $1,000 = **$4,000**

### Example 4: Real Interest Rate

**Given**: Nominal interest rate = 7%, Inflation rate = 3%

**Solution**:
- Real Interest Rate = 7% - 3% = **4%**

### Example 5: Unemployment Rate

**Given**: Population = 300M, Labor Force = 150M, Employed = 140M

**Solution**:
- Unemployed = 150M - 140M = 10M
- Unemployment Rate = (10M/150M) × 100 = **6.67%**
