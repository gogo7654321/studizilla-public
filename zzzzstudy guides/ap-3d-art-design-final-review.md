## 📝 Written Statement

### 3-D Statement Template

```
1,200 CHARACTERS FRAMEWORK:

OPENING (~200-250 characters):
"My investigation explores [3-D concept]
through [materials/processes]. Working in
three dimensions allowed me to [unique
aspect of 3-D exploration]."

PROCESS (~400-500 characters):
"I began by [initial experiments with
material/form]. As I constructed/carved/
assembled, I discovered [finding about
space/form/material]. This led me to
explore [development], taking risks by
[experimentation]."

SYNTHESIS (~300-400 characters):
"Through physically making, I learned
[understanding about 3-D design]. My
work evolved from [beginning] to [end],
revealing how [growth in spatial/material
understanding]."
```

### Strong 3-D Language

```
EFFECTIVE 3-D PHRASES:

FORM:
- "volumetric tension..."
- "mass and void interplay..."
- "positive/negative relationship..."
- "form implies movement..."

SPACE:
- "occupies and activates..."
- "invites circumnavigation..."
- "scale creates intimacy/monumentality..."
- "spatial dialogue..."

MATERIAL:
- "material properties reveal..."
- "physical resistance taught..."
- "process-driven discovery..."
- "structural logic..."

PROCESS:
- "additive accumulation..."
- "subtractive removal revealed..."
- "construction demanded..."
- "assemblage created..."

## 📸 Photography Review

### Capturing 3-D Work

```
ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES:

LIGHTING:
- Directional (creates shadow)
- Reveals form and texture
- Not flat or harsh
- Consistent across views

ANGLES:
- Primary: Most informative
- Secondary: Complementary info
- Consider all viewpoints
- Choose strongest

BACKGROUND:
- Clean, neutral
- Sufficient contrast
- No distractions
- Professional presentation

SCALE:
- Include when needed
- Subtle reference
- Consistent method
- Aids understanding
```

### Common 3-D Photo Errors

```
FIX BEFORE SUBMITTING:

FLAT LIGHTING:
- Add directional light
- Create form-revealing shadows
- Show dimensionality

MISSING ANGLES:
- Multiple views essential
- Don't assume one is enough
- Show full experience

POOR BACKGROUNDS:
- Use seamless paper
- Remove clutter
- Neutral colors
- Professional appearance

SCALE UNCLEAR:
- Add subtle reference
- Context may help
- Consistent approach
- Essential for some work

FORM DOESN'T READ:
- Better lighting
- Different angle
- More contrast
- Re-photograph entirely
```
