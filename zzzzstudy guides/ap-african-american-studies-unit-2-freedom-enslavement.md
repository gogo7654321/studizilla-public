## 🎯 Sub-Theme 1: Slavery in the American Colonies

### Development of Racial Slavery

```
TIMELINE OF DEVELOPMENT:

1619:
First Africans arrive in Virginia
Status ambiguous (indentured?)

1640s-1660s:

1676:
Bacon's Rebellion
Increased racial division after

1705:
Virginia Slave Codes
Comprehensive legal framework

1787:
Constitution and slavery
Three-Fifths Compromise
Fugitive Slave Clause

The shift from varied forms of unfree
labor to race-based hereditary slavery
was a PROCESS, not inevitable.
```
