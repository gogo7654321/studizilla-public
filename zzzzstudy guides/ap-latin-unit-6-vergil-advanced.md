---

## 🎯 Sub-Theme 1: Mastering Dactylic Hexameter

### Basic Meter Review

```
DACTYLIC HEXAMETER:
Six metrical feet per line

FOOT TYPES:
DACTYL: — ∪ ∪ (long-short-short)
SPONDEE: — — (long-long)

PATTERN:
1st foot: Dactyl or Spondee
2nd foot: Dactyl or Spondee
3rd foot: Dactyl or Spondee
4th foot: Dactyl or Spondee (often dactyl)
5th foot: Almost always Dactyl
6th foot: Spondee or Trochee (— ∪)

COMMON LINE STRUCTURE:
— ∪ ∪ | — ∪ ∪ | — ∪ ∪ | — ∪ ∪ | — ∪ ∪ | — x
```

### Scansion Rules

```
VOWEL QUANTITY:

NATURALLY LONG:
- Macron-marked vowels (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū)
- Diphthongs (ae, au, ei, eu, oe, ui)
- Vowel before two consonants
- Contractions

NATURALLY SHORT:
- No macron
- Before single consonant (usually)

ELISION:
When word ends in vowel/m and next 
word begins with vowel/h:
- Final vowel/m is elided (not pronounced)
- Counts as one syllable with following

EXAMPLE:
"mult(um) ill(e) et terris iactatus"
The (um) and (e) elide
```

### Scansion Practice

```
LINE: "Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris"

STEP 1 - Mark elisions:
"Arma virum|qu(e) cano, Troi|ae qui primus ab oris"

STEP 2 - Mark long vowels:
Ār-mă vĭ-rūm-quĕ că-nō, Troi-ae quī prī-mŭs ăb ō-rīs

STEP 3 - Divide into feet:
Ār-mă vĭ | rūm-quĕ că | nō Troi | ae quī | prī-mŭs ăb | ō-rīs

STEP 4 - Mark pattern:
— ∪ ∪ | — ∪ ∪ | — — | — — | — ∪ ∪ | — —
Dactyl | Dactyl | Spondee | Spondee | Dactyl | Spondee

This is DSSDS pattern (common)
```

### Metrical Effects

```
SPONDAIC LINES:
Heavy spondees = slow, solemn, weighty

"Obstipuere; simul attoniti"
— — — | — — | — — | — — | — ∪ ∪ | — —
Emphasizes shock and stillness

DACTYLIC LINES:
Many dactyls = speed, excitement, action

"Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum"
Many dactyls create galloping rhythm
Imitates horse hooves!

ENJAMBMENT:
Thought runs past line end
Creates emphasis on first word of new line

"...magnum
volvere saxum"
"saxum" emphasized by position
```

## 🏛️ Sub-Theme 2: Key Passages from Book 1

### The Proem (Lines 1-11)

```
LATIN:
"Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit
litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram..."

KEY FEATURES:
1. "Arma virumque" - echoes Homer
   (Iliad = arma, Odyssey = virum)
2. "fato" - fate theme introduced
3. "vi superum" - divine intervention
4. "saevae...Iunonis" - Juno's wrath

TRANSLATION:
"I sing of arms and the man, who first 
from the shores of Troy, an exile by fate,
came to Italy and the Lavinian shores,
much tossed about both on land and sea
by the power of the gods above, on account
of the remembering wrath of savage Juno..."
```

### Juno's Speech (1.37-49)

```
KEY PASSAGE:
"Mene incepto desistere victam
nec posse Italia Teucrorum avertere regem?"

TRANSLATION:
"Am I, defeated, to desist from my 
undertaking and not be able to turn away
the king of the Teucrians from Italy?"

RHETORICAL ANALYSIS:
- Indignant rhetorical questions
- "Mene" emphatic pronoun
- Contrast: other gods punish mortals, why can't she?
- Sets up divine opposition theme

GRAMMAR NOTES:
- "Mene" = me + ne (interrogative)
- "victam" = perfect passive participle, modifies "me"
- "desistere...avertere" = infinitives
```

### The Storm Scene (1.81-123)

```
VERGIL'S STORM VOCABULARY:

tempestas, -atis (f.) - storm
fluctus, -us (m.) - wave
ventus, -i (m.) - wind
procella, -ae (f.) - gust
nimbus, -i (m.) - cloud, rainstorm
aequor, -oris (n.) - sea surface
prora, -ae (f.) - prow
puppis, -is (f.) - stern

METRICAL EFFECTS:
Vergil uses meter to imitate storm:

"Insequitur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum"
The repeated -or sound mimics creaking ropes

"Eripiunt subito nubes caelumque diemque"
Spondees slow the line, emphasizing darkness
```

---

## 🔥 Sub-Theme 3: Key Passages from Book 2

### The Fall of Troy

```
CONTEXT:
Aeneas narrates Troy's destruction to Dido
Flashback narrative (told in 1st person)

cinis, -eris (m.) - ashes
```

### Laocoon's Warning (2.40-56)

GRAMMAR:
- "Danaos" = Greek accusative of Danai
- "ferentis" = present participle, accusative plural
  (variant of "ferentes")
- "et" = "even" (adverbial)

FULL CONTEXT:
"Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis."
"Whatever this is, I fear Greeks even bearing gifts."

SIGNIFICANCE:
- Dramatic irony (reader knows outcome)
- Laocoon's wisdom ignored
- Theme: Trojans' blindness to deception
```

### Death of Priam (2.506-558)

```
KEY PASSAGE:
"Haec finis Priami fatorum; hic exitus illum
sorte tulit, Troiam incensam et prolapsa videntem
Pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum
regnatorem Asiae."

TRANSLATION:
"This was the end of Priam's fates; this 
death carried him off by lot, seeing Troy 
burned and Pergama fallen, once the proud 
ruler of Asia over so many peoples and lands."

ANALYSIS:
- "Haec finis...hic exitus" - emphatic demonstratives
- Contrast: former glory vs. current ruin
- "videntem" - he dies seeing destruction
- Pathetic tableau of fallen king
```

### Creusa's Ghost (2.776-794)

```
KEY PASSAGE:
"Quid tantum insano iuvat indulgere dolori,
o dulcis coniunx? Non haec sine numine divum
eveniunt; nec te comitem hinc portare Creusam
fas, aut ille sinit superi regnator Olympi."

TRANSLATION:
"Why does it please you to indulge so much
in insane grief, o sweet husband? These things
do not happen without the will of the gods;
nor is it right for you to carry Creusa hence
as companion, nor does that ruler of high 
Olympus allow it."

THEMES:
- Divine will (numen divum)
- Fate vs. human desire
- Aeneas must abandon personal for mission
- Foreshadows Dido relationship
```

## 💔 Sub-Theme 4: Key Passages from Book 4

### Dido's Love (4.1-30)

```
OPENING:
"At regina gravi iamdudum saucia cura
vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igni."

TRANSLATION:
"But the queen, long since wounded by 
heavy care, nourishes the wound in her 
veins and is seized by hidden fire."

IMAGERY:
- "saucia" (wounded) - love as wound
- "vulnus" (wound) - physical metaphor
- "igni" (fire) - love as consuming fire
- Medical/physical language for emotional state

METER:
"At regina gravi iamdudum saucia cura"
Heavy spondees reflect Dido's heavy heart
```

### Dido's Confession to Anna (4.31-53)

```
KEY PASSAGE:
"Anna, fatebor enim, miseri post fata Sychaei
coniugis et sparsos fraterna caede penatis
solus hic inflexit sensus animumque labantem
impulit."

TRANSLATION:
"Anna, for I will confess, after the death 
of wretched Sychaeus my husband and the 
household gods scattered by my brother's 
murder, this man alone has bent my feelings 
and moved my wavering heart."

GRAMMAR:
- "fatebor" = future deponent
- "post fata" = after death (euphemism)
- "sparsos" = scattered (agrees with penatis)
- "labantem" = wavering (present participle)
```

### The Hunt and Storm (4.160-172)

```
UNION IN THE CAVE:
"Speluncam Dido dux et Troianus eandem
deveniunt. Prima et Tellus et pronuba Iuno
dant signum; fulsere ignes et conscius aether
conubiis, summoque ulularunt vertice Nymphae."

TRANSLATION:
"Dido and the Trojan leader come to the 
same cave. First both Earth and Juno as 
matron of honor give the signal; fires 
flashed and the aether was witness to 
the union, and Nymphs howled on the 
highest peak."

AMBIGUITY:
- Is this a legitimate marriage?
- "pronuba" suggests wedding ritual
- "ulularunt" ominous? celebratory?
- Nature participates (pathetic fallacy)
```

### Dido's Final Speech (4.651-662)

```
"Vixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi,
et nunc magna mei sub terras ibit imago.
Urbem praeclaram statui, mea moenia vidi,
ulta virum poenas inimico a fratre recepi,
felix, heu nimium felix, si litora tantum
numquam Dardaniae tetigissent nostra carinae."

TRANSLATION:
"I have lived and the course which fortune 
gave I have completed, and now my great 
shade will go beneath the earth. I have 
founded a famous city, I have seen my own 
walls, having avenged my husband I have 
exacted punishment from my hostile brother—
happy, alas too happy, if only the Trojan 
ships had never touched our shores."

ANALYSIS:
- List of accomplishments
- Tragic "if only" (past contrary-to-fact)
- "felix...felix" - repetition emphasizes pathos
- Dignified acceptance meets bitter regret
```

### The Golden Bough (6.136-148)

```
SIBYL'S INSTRUCTION:
"Latet arbore opaca
aureus et foliis et lento vimine ramus,
Iunoni infernae dictus sacer; hunc tegit omnis
lucus et obscuris claudunt convallibus umbrae."

TRANSLATION:
"Hidden in a dark tree is a branch golden 
both in leaves and pliant shoot, called 
sacred to infernal Juno; all the grove 
covers this and shadows enclose it in 
dark valleys."

```

### Descent Description (6.268-294)

```
FAMOUS LINES:
"Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram
perque domos Ditis vacuas et inania regna:
quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna
est iter in silvis, ubi caelum condidit umbra
Iuppiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem."

TRANSLATION:
"They went, dim figures, under the lonely 
night through shadow and through the empty 
homes of Dis and his unsubstantial realm:
as is a journey in the forests under the 
uncertain moon in its grudging light, when 
Jupiter has hidden the sky with shadow and 
black night has taken color from things."

METRICAL EFFECTS:
- "Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram"

saecula qui rursus Latio regnata per arva
Saturno quondam..."

TRANSLATION:
"This man, this is he, whom you hear 
promised to you more often, Augustus Caesar, 
offspring of a god, who will establish again 
golden ages in Latium through the fields 
once ruled by Saturn..."

SIGNIFICANCE:

- Justifies present through mythic past
```

### "Tu Regere Imperio" (6.847-853)

```
ROME'S MISSION:
"Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera
(credo equidem), vivos ducent de marmore vultus,
orabunt causas melius, caelique meatus
describent radio et surgentia sidera dicent:
tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento
(hae tibi erunt artes), pacique imponere morem,
parcere subiectis et debellare superbos."

TRANSLATION:
"Others will forge more smoothly bronzes 
that breathe (I believe indeed), will draw 
living faces from marble, will plead cases 
better, and will describe the movements of 
the sky with the rod and will tell of the 
rising stars: you, Roman, remember to rule 
peoples with command (these will be your 
arts), and to impose the custom of peace,
to spare the conquered and war down the proud."

ANALYSIS:
- Acknowledges Greek superiority in arts
- Defines Roman virtue: rule, war, peace
- "parcere subiectis et debellare superbos"
  = mercy + power
- Central statement of Roman identity
