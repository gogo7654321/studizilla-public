## 📝 FRQ Application Strategies

### Common FRQ Topics

**Scenario-Based Applications**
1. **Learning**: Identify classical/operant conditioning in scenarios
2. **Memory**: Explain encoding, storage, retrieval failures
3. **Development**: Apply Piaget, Erikson to cases
4. **Social**: Explain conformity, obedience in real situations
5. **Disorders**: Identify symptoms, explain treatments
6. **Brain**: Connect brain damage to behavioral changes

### FRQ Writing Tips

**Structure**
1. **Define**: Give textbook definition
2. **Apply**: Connect to the specific scenario
3. **Explain**: Show how concept fits the situation

**Example Format**
> **Term**: [Definition]. In this scenario, [how it applies]. This explains why [behavior/outcome].

**Key Phrases**
- "According to [psychologist]..."
- "This demonstrates..."
- "The concept of _____ explains..."
- "This is an example of..."

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't just define—always apply
- Don't confuse similar concepts (reinforcement vs punishment)
- Don't forget negative examples (what something is NOT)
- Don't use circular definitions
