## 📊 Piaget's Four Stages

### Overview

| Stage | Age | Key Feature |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Sensorimotor** | 0-2 years | Object permanence |
| **Preoperational** | 2-7 years | Symbolic thought; egocentrism |
| **Concrete Operational** | 7-11 years | Logical operations |
| **Formal Operational** | 11+ years | Abstract thought |

---

## 👶 Stage 1: Sensorimotor (0-2)

### Key Achievements

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Object permanence** | Objects exist when out of sight |
| Develops | Around 8 months |
| Test | Hide toy under blanket |

### Substages

| Substage | Age | Behavior |
|----------|-----|----------|
| 1-4 | 0-8 mo | Reflexes → intentional actions |
| 5-6 | 8-24 mo | Object permanence → mental representations |

---

## 🎨 Stage 2: Preoperational (2-7)

### Key Features

| Feature | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Symbolic thought** | Use symbols/language | Pretend play |
| **Egocentrism** | Can't take others' perspective | Three mountains task |
| **Animism** | Inanimate objects are alive | "The sun is angry" |
| **Artificialism** | Humans made everything | "Who made the mountains?" |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Definition | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Centration** | Focus on one aspect | Tall glass = more water |
| **Lack of conservation** | Appearance changes = amount changes | Same water, different glasses |
| **Irreversibility** | Can't mentally reverse actions | Can't undo pouring |

### Conservation Tasks

| Task | What Changes | What Stays Same |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Liquid | Glass shape | Amount of water |
| Number | Spacing of objects | Number of objects |
| Mass | Shape of clay | Amount of clay |

---

## 🔧 Stage 3: Concrete Operational (7-11)

### Key Achievements

| Skill | Definition |

| **Conservation** | Amount unchanged despite appearance |
| **Reversibility** | Mental reversal of actions |
| **Decentration** | Consider multiple aspects |
| **Classification** | Organize into categories |
| **Seriation** | Arrange in logical order |

### Still Limited To

| **Invincibility fable** | Bad things won't happen to me |

---

## 🔬 Criticisms of Piaget

| Criticism | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Underestimated children | Infants show object permanence earlier |
| Stage boundaries | Development more gradual/continuous |
| Culture | Stages may vary by culture |
| Domain-general | Skills may be domain-specific |

---

## 👥 Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory

### Core Ideas

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Social learning** | Cognitive development is social |
| **Cultural tools** | Language, symbols shape thought |
| **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)** | Gap between independent and assisted ability |
| **Scaffolding** | Support to reach next level |

### Zone of Proximal Development

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Can't do, even with help            │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │     ZPD: Can do with help         │  │
│  │  ┌─────────────────────────────┐  │  │
│  │  │  Can do independently       │  │  │
│  │  └─────────────────────────────┘  │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Scaffolding

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Provide support | Teacher helps with problem |
| Gradually remove | Less help as student learns |
| Transfer control | Student works independently |

---

## 🆚 Piaget vs. Vygotsky

| Feature | Piaget | Vygotsky |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Development driver | Internal exploration | Social interaction |
| Language | Follows development | Drives development |
| Stages | Universal | Culturally variable |
| Learning | Discovery | Scaffolding |
| Role of culture | Minimal | Central |

---

## 🖥️ Information Processing Approach

### Computer Analogy

| Human | Computer |
|-------|----------|
| Input (senses) | Input (keyboard) |
| Processing (thinking) | CPU |
| Storage (memory) | Hard drive |
| Output (behavior) | Monitor/printer |

### Key Points

- Development is gradual, continuous
- Focus on attention, memory, processing speed
- These improve with age
- More quantitative than qualitative changes

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Object permanence | ~8 months; sensorimotor |
| Egocentrism | Preoperational; three mountains |
| Conservation | Concrete operational; amount unchanged |

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: A developmental psychologist is studying children at different ages. Describe how each of the following would be used or observed:

(a) Piaget's concept of conservation
(b) Ainsworth's Strange Situation
(c) Erikson's identity vs. role confusion
(d) Kohlberg's preconventional morality

**Answer**:

(a) **Piaget's concept of conservation**: The psychologist could test whether children understand that quantity remains the same despite changes in appearance. For example, showing a child two identical glasses of water, then pouring one into a tall thin glass. Children in the preoperational stage (ages 2-7) would say the tall glass has "more," while children in the concrete operational stage (7-11) would understand the amount is the same. This tests whether the child can focus on multiple dimensions and mentally reverse the action.

(b) **Ainsworth's Strange Situation**: The psychologist would observe how an infant (typically 12-18 months) responds to brief separations from their caregiver. The procedure involves the caregiver leaving and returning while a stranger is present. Attachment style is classified based on the child's behavior: secure children show distress at separation but are easily comforted upon reunion; avoidant children show little distress and may ignore the parent; anxious-ambivalent children are extremely distressed and may be angry at reunion.

(c) **Erikson's identity vs. role confusion**: The psychologist would study adolescents (approximately ages 12-20) to see how they are forming their sense of identity. Questions might address career goals, values, beliefs, and sense of self. A successful resolution shows a coherent sense of who they are and where they're going. Role confusion would be shown by inability to commit to goals, values, or self-concept, and trying on many different identities without resolution.

(d) **Kohlberg's preconventional morality**: The psychologist would present moral dilemmas (like the Heinz dilemma) to children and analyze their reasoning. Preconventional reasoning (typically younger children) focuses on self-interest: Stage 1 avoids punishment ("He shouldn't steal because he'll go to jail"), and Stage 2 seeks rewards ("He should steal because he needs his wife to take care of him"). The focus is on what happens to the self, not on social norms or abstract principles.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Mixing up Piaget stages | Use age ranges and key features |
| Confusing Erikson and Piaget | Erikson = social/emotional; Piaget = cognitive |
| Wrong Kohlberg level | Preconv = self; Conv = society; Postconv = principles |
| Secure vs. insecure attachment | Secure = distress + comfort at reunion |
