## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE similarity AND ONE difference between the New England and Chesapeake colonies.**

*Sample Answer:*
"One similarity between New England and Chesapeake was that both regions developed representative assemblies, with Virginia's House of Burgesses (1619) and Massachusetts's General Court giving colonists some voice in government. However, a significant difference was their primary motivation for settlement: New England was founded primarily for religious purposes by Puritans seeking to create a 'city upon a hill,' while the Chesapeake was founded for economic reasons, particularly the pursuit of profit through tobacco cultivation."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain how the Great Awakening contributed to the development of American identity.**

*Sample Answer:*
"The Great Awakening contributed to American identity by creating a shared religious experience that transcended colonial boundaries. George Whitefield's touring revivals drew massive crowds in every colony, creating a common cultural moment. The movement's emphasis on individual faith and its challenge to established authority encouraged egalitarian ideals that would later influence revolutionary thinking, as people who questioned religious hierarchy became more willing to question political hierarchy as well."
