Unit 6 covers melodic construction, embellishing tones, phrase structure, and the melodic dictation skills essential for AP exam success.

---

## 🎵 6.1 Melodic Structure

### Melodic Contour

```
CONTOUR: The shape of a melody

ASCENDING: Rising motion
C → D → E → F → G
Creates energy, tension

DESCENDING: Falling motion
G → F → E → D → C
Creates resolution, relaxation

ARCH: Up then down
C → E → G → E → C
Common, balanced shape

INVERTED ARCH: Down then up
G → E → C → E → G
Less common, creates tension

WAVE: Alternating motion
C → E → D → F → E → G
Most melodies combine shapes
```

### Melodic Range

```
RANGE: Distance from lowest to highest

NARROW RANGE (5th or less):
Easy to sing
Folk songs, children's music

MODERATE RANGE (octave):
Most common
Standard vocal range

WIDE RANGE (more than octave):
More dramatic
Instrumental or virtuosic

TESSITURA:
The "comfortable" range
Where most notes lie
May differ from full range
```

### Melodic Motion Types

```
TYPES OF MOTION:

CONJUNCT (Stepwise):
Moving by 2nds
C → D → E → D → C
Smooth, singable

DISJUNCT (Leaps):
Moving by 3rd or larger
C → G → E → C → G
More dramatic, angular

BALANCED MELODY:
Mix of steps and leaps
Leap followed by step (often)
Creates interest with singability
```

## 🎭 6.2 Non-Chord Tones (Embellishments)

### Passing Tones

```
PASSING TONE (PT):
Connects two chord tones by step

UNACCENTED PASSING TONE:
On weak beat/weak part of beat

Chord: C-E-G
│ C  D  E │
  ↑  ↑  ↑
  CT PT CT

D is passing tone between C and E

ACCENTED PASSING TONE (APT):
On strong beat

│ D  E │  (D on downbeat)
  ↑  ↑
  PT CT

More dissonant, more expressive
```

### Neighbor Tones

```
NEIGHBOR TONE (NT):
Step away from chord tone and back

UPPER NEIGHBOR (UN):
│ E  F  E │
  ↑  ↑  ↑
  CT UN CT

LOWER NEIGHBOR (LN):
│ E  D  E │
  ↑  ↑  ↑
  CT LN CT

CHANGING TONE (Double Neighbor):
│ E  F  D  E │
Leaves and approaches from opposite side
```

### Suspensions

```
SUSPENSION (SUS):
Three parts: Preparation-Suspension-Resolution

PREPARATION: Chord tone on weak beat
SUSPENSION: Held into strong beat (dissonance)
RESOLUTION: Steps down to chord tone

4-3 SUSPENSION:
│ G  G→ F  E │  
  P  S     R
Suspends 4th, resolves to 3rd

7-6 SUSPENSION:
Suspends 7th, resolves to 6th

9-8 SUSPENSION:
Suspends 9th (2nd), resolves to octave

2-3 SUSPENSION (Bass):
Suspends 2nd, resolves up to 3rd
```

### Retardation

```
RETARDATION:
Like suspension but resolves UP

│ B → B → C │
  P    R    RES

Retards resolution of leading tone
(Upward resolution)

Less common than suspension
Creates yearning quality
```

### Anticipation

```
ANTICIPATION (ANT):
Arrives at next chord tone early

│ E  G │ G ... │
     ↑
    ANT

The G anticipates the next chord
Unaccented (on weak beat)
Creates forward momentum
```

### Escape Tone and Appoggiatura

```
ESCAPE TONE (Échappée):
Step away, LEAP back

│ C  D  G │
  ↑  ↑  ↑
  CT ET CT

Steps to D, leaps to G

APPOGGIATURA (APP):
LEAP to dissonance, step to resolution

│ G  C │ (leap to C)
│ C  B │ (step down to B)
     ↑
    APP

Approached by leap, left by step
Usually accented (strong beat)
Very expressive
```

### Pedal Tone

```
PEDAL (Pedal Point):
Sustained or repeated note
While harmony changes above/below

TONIC PEDAL:
Bass holds tonic through chord changes

DOMINANT PEDAL:
Bass holds dominant (5)
Creates tension before cadence

INVERTED PEDAL:
Held in upper voice (not bass)

Example (C major):
C pedal: │ C  C  C  C │
Chords:   I  ii V  I
```

## 🎼 6.3 Non-Chord Tone Summary

```
NCT IDENTIFICATION TABLE:

Name          Approach  Leave    Beat
Passing Tone  Step      Step     Weak (usually)
Neighbor      Step      Step     Weak
             (returns to origin)
Suspension    Common    Step ↓   Strong
Retardation   Common    Step ↑   Strong
Anticipation  Any       Common   Weak
Escape Tone   Step      Leap     Weak
Appoggiatura  Leap      Step     Strong
Pedal         Held      Held     Any

KEY: 
Common = same as chord tone
Step/Leap = melodic direction
```

## 📝 6.4 Phrase Structure

### Phrases and Periods

```
PHRASE:
Musical "sentence"
Usually 4-8 measures
Ends with cadence

PERIOD:
Two phrases that form a unit

ANTECEDENT PHRASE:
First phrase ("question")
Usually ends with HC or IAC

CONSEQUENT PHRASE:
Second phrase ("answer")
Usually ends with PAC
```

### Period Types

```
PARALLEL PERIOD:
Antecedent and consequent start similarly

│ a ─────────── HC │ a ─────────── PAC │
Same beginning, different ending

CONTRASTING PERIOD:
Phrases have different material

│ a ─────────── HC │ b ─────────── PAC │
Different beginnings

SYMMETRIC PERIOD:
Equal phrase lengths (4+4, 8+8)

ASYMMETRIC:
Unequal phrase lengths (4+6, etc.)
```

### Phrase Expansion

```
PHRASE EXTENSION TECHNIQUES:

REPETITION:
Repeat a motive or figure

SEQUENCE:
Repeat pattern at different pitch

FRAGMENTATION:
Repeat smaller portion of motive

EXTENSION:
Add measures before cadence

ELISION:
End of one phrase = start of next
Overlapping phrases
```

### Sentence Structure

```
SENTENCE:
Different from period
Single phrase with internal logic

PRESENTATION (mm. 1-4):
Motive + repetition/sequence

CONTINUATION (mm. 5-8):
Development, fragmentation
Leads to cadence

STRUCTURE:
│ Basic idea │ Repeat/Sequence │ Fragmentation → Cadence │
    mm. 1-2       mm. 3-4              mm. 5-8
```

## 🎵 6.5 Melodic Dictation

### Listening Strategies

```
DICTATION APPROACH:

FIRST HEARING:
- Identify key and meter
- Listen for overall contour
- Mark phrase endings

SECOND HEARING:
- Write scale degrees or solfège
- Focus on intervals
- Note rhythmic patterns

THIRD HEARING:
- Fill in details
- Verify intervals
- Check for NCTs

FINAL CHECK:
- Sing back internally
- Verify rhythm
- Confirm notation
```

### Using Solfège

```
SOLFÈGE SYSTEMS:

FIXED DO:
Do = C always
Helps with pitch identification

MOVABLE DO:
Do = Tonic of key
Helps with scale degree function

SCALE DEGREE NUMBERS:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Functional understanding

RECOMMENDED:
Use what works for you
Be consistent!
```

### Common Melodic Patterns

```
PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE:

ARPEGGIATED:
1-3-5-8 (triad outline)
Common at phrase starts

SCALAR:
1-2-3-4-5 (scale passage)
Conjunct motion

NEIGHBOR FIGURE:
5-6-5 or 3-2-3
Decorative pattern

SEQUENCE:
Pattern repeating at new pitch
Listen for repetition

CADENTIAL:
7-1 (leading tone resolution)
2-1 (scale descent)
5-1 (leap to tonic)
```

### Notation Tips

```
WRITING DICTATION:

1. ESTABLISH TONIC
   Hear/sing tonic first
   Orient yourself

2. USE CONTOUR
   Draw shape first
   Fill in pitches

3. MARK BEATS
   Align rhythm with pulse
   Show meter clearly

4. CHECK INTERVALS
   Verify leaps
   Especially 4ths, 5ths, 8ves

5. REVIEW NCTs
   Are passing/neighbor tones
   Correctly notated?
```

## ✍️ 6.6 Melodic Composition

### Melody Writing Guidelines

```
COMPOSING EFFECTIVE MELODIES:

1. ESTABLISH KEY
   Begin and end on tonic
   Or end phrase on dominant

2. BALANCE MOTION
   Mix steps and leaps
   Compensate large leaps

3. CLIMAX
   Build to high point
   Usually in second half

4. SHAPE
   Clear contour
   Avoid rambling

5. CADENTIAL MOTION
   Strong endings
   2-1 or 7-1 at cadence
```

### Melodic Interval Guidelines

```
INTERVAL USAGE:

PREFERRED:
- 2nds (steps) most common
- 3rds very singable
- P4, P5 for leaps
- P8 occasionally (dramatic)

AVOID:
- A2 (awkward to sing)
- A4/d5 (tritone) - unstable
- 7ths (difficult)
- Consecutive large leaps

AFTER LARGE LEAP:
Move by step in opposite direction
(Compensatory motion)
```

### Using Non-Chord Tones

```
ADDING NCTs TO MELODY:

1. WRITE STRUCTURAL MELODY
   Chord tones on strong beats
   Clear harmonic outline

2. ADD EMBELLISHMENTS
   Passing tones between
   Neighbors for decoration

3. CONSIDER RHYTHM
   NCTs often shorter values
   Main tones on beats

4. DON'T OVERDO
   Too many NCTs = chaos
   Balance is key
```

---

## 📏 6.7 Harmonizing Melodies

### Melody-Harmony Relationship

```
DETERMINING HARMONY FROM MELODY:

1. IDENTIFY CHORD TONES
   Notes on strong beats
   Suggest chord choice

2. CHECK BASS MOTION
   Root movement options
   Smooth bass line

3. CONSIDER FUNCTION
   Phrase beginning = T
   Pre-cadence = S or D
   Cadence = V → I

EXAMPLE:
Melody: E - D - C (in C major)
Beat 1: E = chord tone of C or Am
Beat 2: D = chord tone of G or Dm
Beat 3: C = chord tone of C or Am
Progression: I - V - I or I - V - vi
```

### Implied Harmony

```
MELODY IMPLIES HARMONY:

ARPEGGIATED FIGURES:
C-E-G implies C major chord

SCALE PASSAGES:
May pass through multiple harmonies
Chord tones on strong beats

NCTs DON'T DEFINE CHORD:
Passing tone on beat 3
Doesn't determine harmony
Look for structural tones
```

## 💡 Exam Tips

```
NCT IDENTIFICATION:

1. FIND CHORD TONES FIRST
   Strong beats usually = CT
   
2. ASK: How approached?
   Step or leap?
   
3. ASK: How left?
   Step or leap?
   
4. ASK: What beat?
   Strong = sus, app
   Weak = PT, NT, ant, et

MNEMONIC FOR COMMON NCTs:
"Pass the Neighbor, Sue"
PT (step-step)
NT (step-step, returns)
Sus (preparation-suspension-resolution)
```
