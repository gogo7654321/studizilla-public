| **Savings accounts** | Less liquid |
| **Small time deposits** | CDs < $100,000 |
| **Money market funds** | Mutual funds |

### What's NOT Money

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Credit cards** | Debt, not money |
| **Stocks/bonds** | Financial assets |
| **Checks** | Just instructions |

---

## 🏦 Banking System

### Fractional Reserve Banking

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Banks hold fraction of deposits as reserves |
| **Required reserves** | Minimum by Fed |
| **Excess reserves** | Above minimum |
| **Loan out** | Excess reserves |

### Bank Balance Sheet

| Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| Reserves | Deposits |
| Loans | Borrowings |
| Securities | Net worth |

### Reserve Requirement

| Formula | |
|---------|--|
| **Required reserves** | = Reserve ratio × Deposits |
| **Excess reserves** | = Total reserves - Required reserves |
| **Loanable** | = Excess reserves |

### Example

| Given | |
|-------|--|
| **Deposits** | $1,000,000 |
| **Reserve ratio** | 10% |
| **Required reserves** | $100,000 |
| **Excess reserves** | $900,000 (if all kept) |

---

## 💵 Money Creation

### How Banks Create Money

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| **1** | Deposit made |
| **2** | Bank keeps required reserves |
| **3** | Bank loans excess |
| **4** | Loan becomes deposit at another bank |
| **5** | Process repeats |

### Money Multiplier

| Formula | |
|---------|--|
| **Simple money multiplier** | = 1 / Reserve ratio |
| **ΔMoney supply** | = ΔExcess reserves × Multiplier |

### Example

| Given | |
|-------|--|
| **Reserve ratio** | 10% |
| **Multiplier** | 1 / 0.10 = 10 |
| **New deposit** | $1,000 |
| **Maximum ΔMS** | $1,000 × 10 = $10,000 |
| **But wait** | Only excess creates money |
| **Excess** | $1,000 - $100 = $900 |
| **Actual ΔMS** | $900 × 10 = $9,000 |

### Important Clarification

| If | Then Max ΔMS = |
|----|----------------|
| **New deposit** | (Deposit - Required) × Multiplier |
| **Fed adds reserves** | Reserves × Multiplier |
| **Fed buys bonds** | Bond purchase × Multiplier |

### Limitations on Money Creation

| Factor | Effect |

| **Banks hold excess** | Less lending; smaller multiplier |
| **Cash drains** | People hold cash; less in banks |
| **Loan demand** | Need willing borrowers |

## 🧮 Money Multiplier Derivations

### Simple Money Multiplier

**Key Insight:** Each dollar of reserves supports multiple dollars of deposits

```
Reserve Requirement = 10% (or 0.10)

Round 1: $1,000 deposit
├── Required reserves: $100 (kept)
└── Excess reserves: $900 (loaned out)

Round 2: $900 becomes deposit elsewhere
├── Required reserves: $90
└── Excess reserves: $810 (loaned out)

Round 3: $810 becomes deposit
├── Required reserves: $81
└── Excess reserves: $729 (loaned out)

... continues ...
```

**Mathematical Derivation:**
$$\text{Total Deposits} = \$900 \times (1 + 0.9 + 0.9^2 + 0.9^3 + ...)$$

$$= \$900 \times \frac{1}{1-0.9} = \$900 \times 10 = \$9,000$$

$$\boxed{\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{RR} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10}$$

### Important Distinctions

| Scenario | Maximum ΔMoney Supply |
|----------|----------------------|
| **New deposit** | (Deposit - Required Reserves) × Multiplier |
| **Fed buys bonds** | Purchase Amount × Multiplier |
| **Fed changes RR** | Affects multiplier size itself |

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Fed Open Market Purchase**
```
Fed buys $50 million in bonds
Reserve Requirement = 20%
Money Multiplier = 1/0.20 = 5

Maximum ΔMS = $50 million × 5 = $250 million
```

**Example 2: New Deposit**
```
Customer deposits $10,000 cash
Reserve Requirement = 10%
Money Multiplier = 1/0.10 = 10

Required Reserves = $10,000 × 0.10 = $1,000
Excess Reserves = $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000

Maximum ΔMS = $9,000 × 10 = $90,000
(Note: Original deposit already counted in money supply)
```

## 📝 FRQ Practice: Unit 4

### Question 1: Money Creation

**A bank receives a new deposit of $50,000. The required reserve ratio is 20%.**

**(a)** Calculate the required reserves and excess reserves.

**(b)** Calculate the simple money multiplier.

**(c)** What is the maximum amount the money supply can increase from this deposit?

**(d)** Explain two reasons why the actual increase might be less than the maximum.

### Model Answer 1:

**(a)** 
```
Required Reserves = Deposit × RR = $50,000 × 0.20 = $10,000
Excess Reserves = Deposit - Required = $50,000 - $10,000 = $40,000
```

**(b)** 
```
Money Multiplier = 1/RR = 1/0.20 = 5
```

**(c)** 
```
Maximum ΔMS = Excess Reserves × Multiplier = $40,000 × 5 = $200,000
```

**(d)** Two reasons actual increase may be less:

1. **Banks may hold excess reserves:** In uncertain times, banks may prefer to keep reserves above the minimum rather than lending them out, reducing the multiplier effect.

2. **Cash drains:** Borrowers may withdraw some loans as cash rather than redepositing, removing funds from the banking system and reducing further money creation.

---

### Question 2: Monetary Policy Transmission

**The Federal Reserve decides to implement expansionary monetary policy by purchasing government bonds.**

**(a)** Show the effect on the money market graph. What happens to the interest rate?

**(b)** Show the effect on the loanable funds market. What happens to investment?

**(c)** Show the effect on the AD-AS graph. What happens to real GDP and price level?

**(d)** In an open economy, what additional effect occurs through exchange rates?

### Model Answer 2:

**(a)** Money Market:
- Money supply curve shifts RIGHT
- Interest rate FALLS from r₁ to r₂
- (Graph shows MS shift right, movement along MD curve)

**(b)** Loanable Funds:
- Lower interest rates → More investment demanded
- Investment INCREASES from I₁ to I₂
- (Graph shows movement along demand curve as r falls)

**(c)** AD-AS:
- Higher investment means more spending
- AD shifts RIGHT
- Real GDP INCREASES
- Price level INCREASES
- (Graph shows AD shift right along SRAS)

**(d)** Open Economy Effect:
- Lower US interest rates → Capital outflow
- Supply of dollars increases → Dollar DEPRECIATES
- Depreciation makes US exports cheaper, imports more expensive
- Net exports INCREASE
- AD shifts RIGHT even more (reinforcing effect)

---

### Question 3: Comparing Policies

**Compare the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in each scenario:**

**(a)** During a severe recession when banks are reluctant to lend

**(b)** When the economy is near full employment

### Model Answer 3:

**(a)** During severe recession (liquidity trap):
- **Less effective**
- Banks may hold excess reserves rather than lending ("pushing on a string")
- Interest rates may already be near zero (lower bound)
- Businesses may not want to invest regardless of low rates
- Fed may need unconventional tools (QE, forward guidance)

**(b)** Near full employment:
- **More effective but problematic**
- Lower rates will stimulate spending, but economy already near capacity
- Main effect will be INFLATION rather than real GDP growth
- SRAS will eventually shift left as wages rise
- Long-run: Only price level rises, no real gain
