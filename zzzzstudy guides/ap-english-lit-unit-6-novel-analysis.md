## 📝 Sub-Theme 2: Narrative Voice and Point of View

### Types of Narration

```
FIRST PERSON:
"I went to the store."

Advantages:
- Intimacy with narrator
- Limited but deep perspective
- Voice characterization

Limitations:
- Only knows own thoughts
- Reliability questions
- Can't show what narrator doesn't see

Types:
- Protagonist narrator (tells own story)
- Peripheral narrator (tells others' story)
- Naive narrator (limited understanding)
- Unreliable narrator (distorts truth)


THIRD PERSON LIMITED:
"She went to the store."

Advantages:
- Close to one character
- Some objective distance
- Focused perspective

Limitations:
- Limited to one viewpoint
- Can't access other minds
- Still somewhat restricted


THIRD PERSON OMNISCIENT:
"She went to the store, thinking..."
"Meanwhile, he was at home..."

Advantages:
- Access to all characters
- God-like overview
- Flexibility

Limitations:
- Less intimacy
- Can feel distant
- Requires skilled handling


SECOND PERSON:
"You go to the store."

Rare, experimental
- Present tense common
- Reader as character
- Unusual effect
```

### Free Indirect Discourse

```
DEFINITION:
Third-person narration that slips into
character's thoughts and voice without
explicit markers like "she thought."

EXAMPLES:

DIRECT THOUGHT:
She thought, "This party is dreadful."

INDIRECT THOUGHT:
She thought that the party was dreadful.

FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE:
This party was dreadful. The canapes 
were soggy, the music intolerable.

→ Blends narrator and character
→ No "she thought"
→ Character's words/feelings
→ Narrator's third-person frame

EFFECT:
- Intimacy with character
- Ironic distance possible
- Reader sees and judges
- Austen, Flaubert, Woolf excel
```

### The Unreliable Narrator

```
TYPES OF UNRELIABILITY:

THE LIAR:
- Deliberately misleads
- Hides information
- Gone Girl's narrators

THE NAIVE:
- Doesn't understand events
- Limited comprehension
- Huck Finn, Stevens (Remains of the Day)

THE DELUDED:
- Self-deceived
- Distorted perception
- Humbert Humbert (Lolita)

THE MAD:
- Mental instability
- Paranoid, confused
- Poe's narrators

DETECTING UNRELIABILITY:
- Contradictions in story
- Gaps and omissions
- Others' reactions differ
- Excessive self-justification
- Reader's discomfort
- Ironic signals from author
```

### Narrative Distance

```
PSYCHIC DISTANCE:

VERY CLOSE:
She was absolutely furious at him, that
insufferable, pompous, ridiculous man.
→ We're in her head

CLOSE:
She felt fury rising. He was insufferable.
→ Still intimate

MODERATE:
She grew angry as she listened to him speak.
→ Observing her

DISTANT:
The woman's expression changed as the 
man continued speaking.
→ Camera view

VERY DISTANT:
At the party, one guest appeared to 
disagree with another.
→ Newspaper report

SKILLED NOVELISTS VARY DISTANCE:
- Close for intimacy
- Distant for perspective
- Shifts create effect
```

---

## 📊 Sub-Theme 3: Novel Structure

### Plot Structures

```
TRADITIONAL (Freytag):

Exposition → Rising Action → Climax →
Falling Action → Resolution

Works well for:
- Victorian novels
- Genre fiction
- Clear conflict/resolution


EPISODIC:
Connected episodes, looser structure
- Picaresque novels
- Don Quixote
- Adventures of Huckleberry Finn


FRAME NARRATIVE:
Story within a story
- Wuthering Heights
- Frankenstein
- Heart of Darkness
- Multiple perspectives, distances


PARALLEL PLOTS:
Multiple storylines intersecting
- Dickens's novels
- Middlemarch
- Cloud Atlas


CIRCULAR:
Ends where it begins
- Finnegans Wake
- One Hundred Years of Solitude
- Emphasizes cycles, fate


FRAGMENTARY:
Non-chronological, disjointed
- Modernist novels
- As I Lay Dying
- The Sound and the Fury
```

### Pacing in Novels

```
CONTROLLING TIME:

SCENE:
- Real-time action
- Dialogue, moment-by-moment
- Slow pacing, full detail
- Important moments

SUMMARY:
- Compressed time
- "Three years passed..."
- Fast pacing
- Less important periods

STRETCH:
- Narration longer than event
- Slow-motion effect
- Interior monologue
- Psychological intensity

PAUSE:
- Description stops action
- Setting, reflection
- Time frozen
- Author commentary

ELLIPSIS:
- Time skipped entirely
- Gap in narrative
- Reader infers
- "Five years later..."
```

### Chapter and Division Functions

```
CHAPTERS CAN:

1. MARK TIME SHIFTS:
   - Days, years passing
   - "Part Two: 1985"

2. SHIFT PERSPECTIVE:
   - Different narrator
   - Different character focus

3. CREATE SUSPENSE:
   - Cliffhanger endings
   - Reader kept turning pages

4. SIGNAL THEMATIC SECTIONS:
   - Novel's "movements"
   - Changing focus

5. PROVIDE BREATHING ROOM:
   - Natural pauses
   - Processing time

ANALYZING DIVISIONS:
- Why break here?
- What's emphasized?
- How does structure meaning?
```

## 👤 Sub-Theme 4: Character Development

### Round vs. Flat Characters

```
E.M. FORSTER'S DISTINCTION:

ROUND CHARACTERS:
- Complex, multi-dimensional
- Capable of surprising us
- Change through novel
- Psychologically real
- Usually protagonists

FLAT CHARACTERS:
- One dominant trait
- Recognizable type
- Consistent throughout
- Supporting roles
- Can be memorable (Dickens)

NEITHER IS "BETTER":
- Different functions
- Flat can be comic, vivid
- Round requires space to develop
- Most novels mix both
```

### Character Arc

```
PROTAGONIST'S JOURNEY:

Beginning State:
- Who is character?
- What do they want?
- What do they lack?

Inciting Incident:
- What disrupts equilibrium?
- What sets story in motion?

Struggles and Conflicts:
- External obstacles
- Internal conflicts
- Relationships tested

Crisis/Climax:
- Greatest challenge
- Forced choice
- Truth revealed

Resolution:
- How have they changed?
- What have they learned?
- New equilibrium?

NOT ALL CHARACTERS CHANGE:
- Some resist change (tragic)
- Some can't change (determinism)
- Static protagonist = theme statement
```

### Foils and Doubles

```
FOIL:
Character who contrasts with protagonist
to highlight protagonist's traits

Examples:
- Banquo to Macbeth
- Rochester's first wife to Jane Eyre
- Tom to Gatsby

Purpose:
- Illuminates protagonist
- Shows alternative choices
- Creates comparison


DOUBLE/DOPPELGÄNGER:
Character mirroring protagonist
in disturbing ways

Examples:
- Jekyll and Hyde
- Frankenstein and monster
- Heathcliff and Hareton

Purpose:
- Explores split self
- Hidden desires
- Psychological complexity
```

### Analyzing Characterization

```
DIRECT CHARACTERIZATION:
Author tells us about character
"John was a generous man."

INDIRECT CHARACTERIZATION:
Actions, speech, thoughts, others' reactions
"John gave his last dollar to the beggar."

WHAT TO ANALYZE:

1. APPEARANCE:
   - Physical description
   - Clothing choices
   - How seen by others

2. SPEECH:
   - Dialect, vocabulary
   - What they talk about
   - How they communicate

3. ACTIONS:
   - Choices made
   - Behaviors
   - Habits

4. THOUGHTS:
   - Interior life
   - Desires, fears

5. RELATIONSHIPS:
   - How they treat others
   - How others treat them
   - Power dynamics

6. ENVIRONMENT:
   - Where they live
   - Their spaces
   - Objects they value
```

## 🌍 Sub-Theme 5: Setting and Atmosphere

### Setting as More Than Backdrop

```
SETTING FUNCTIONS:

1. ESTABLISHES CONTEXT:
   - Historical period
   - Social conditions
   - Cultural norms

2. CREATES ATMOSPHERE:
   - Mood and tone
   - Emotional environment
   - Reader's feeling

3. REFLECTS CHARACTER:
   - Space mirrors psychology
   - Choices reveal character
   - Objects symbolize

4. SHAPES PLOT:
   - Limited options
   - Determines conflicts
   - Enables/constrains action

5. EMBODIES THEME:
   - Setting as symbol
   - Nature vs. society
   - Confinement vs. freedom
```

### Types of Setting

```
GEOGRAPHICAL:
- Region, country, landscape
- City vs. rural
- Climate, terrain

TEMPORAL:
- Historical period
- Season, time of day
- Time passing

SOCIAL:
- Class, community
- Cultural context
- Institutions

DOMESTIC:
- Specific houses, rooms
- Interior spaces
- Personal environments

Example - Wuthering Heights:
- Geographical: Yorkshire moors
- Temporal: Early 19th century
- Social: Rural gentry class
- Domestic: Contrasting houses
  (wild Heights vs. civilized Grange)
```

### Atmosphere and Mood

```
CREATING ATMOSPHERE:

WORD CHOICE:
- Connotations
- Sensory details

IMAGERY:
- Visual details
- Sound, smell, touch
- Weather, lighting

PACING:
- Sentence length
- Event speed
- Tension level

TONE:
- Narrator's attitude
- Ironic vs. sincere
- Warm vs. cold

Example - Gothic Atmosphere:
"The house stood on a slight rise 
just on the edge of the village...
Within, walls continued upright, 
bricks met neatly, floors were firm, 
and doors sensibly shut; silence lay 
steadily against the wood and stone."
            - Shirley Jackson

Analysis: Deceptively calm language
creates unease through its very 
ordinariness, suggesting something
is wrong beneath the surface.
```

## 💭 Sub-Theme 6: Themes in the Novel

        life that the novel explores

NOT:

BUT:
- A complete statement
- An insight or observation
- Open to interpretation

Examples:
NOT: "The novel is about love."
BUT: "The novel suggests that love
     requires sacrifice of self."

NOT: "Ambition"
BUT: "Unchecked ambition destroys
     not only the individual but
     corrupts all relationships."
```

- Nostalgia
- Mortality

MORAL COMPLEXITY:
- Good and evil
- Moral ambiguity
- Ethical choices
```

### Tracing Themes

```
METHODS FOR FINDING THEMES:

1. RECURRING IMAGES:
   What images repeat?
   What do they suggest?

2. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:
   What do characters learn?
   How do they change?

3. CONFLICT AND RESOLUTION:
   What conflicts drive plot?
   How are they resolved (or not)?

4. TITLE AND EPIGRAPH:
   What does title suggest?
   Why this epigraph?

5. BEGINNING AND ENDING:
   How does novel open?
   How does it close?
   What's the difference?

   What do characters discuss?
   What insights emerge?
```

## 🔍 Sub-Theme 7: Analyzing Prose Style

### Elements of Prose Style

```
DICTION:
- Word choice
- Formal/informal
- Abstract/concrete
- Latinate/Anglo-Saxon

SYNTAX:
- Sentence structure
- Length and variety
- Complexity
- Rhythm

IMAGERY:

TONE:

```

### Comparing Prose Styles

```
HEMINGWAY:
Short sentences. Simple words. 
Dialogue. Subtext. Iceberg theory.
"He drank coffee. It was good."

FAULKNER:
Long, winding sentences that seem to 
contain multitudes and never quite 
arrive where you expect them to go, 
circling back on themselves, adding 
clause after clause, dense with memory 
and meaning and the weight of history.

AUSTEN:
Balanced sentences with ironic 
precision, free indirect discourse 
slipping between narrator and 
character, social observation 
delivered with wit.

WOOLF:
Consciousness flowing, images 
drifting, time elastic, interiority 
made prose, the moment expanded, 
the self permeable, boundaries 
between minds dissolving...
```

### Analyzing a Passage

```
CLOSE READING STEPS:

1. READ MULTIPLE TIMES:
   - First for meaning
   - Then for technique
   - Then for effect

2. NOTE STANDOUT FEATURES:
   - Unusual word choices

   - Thematic significance?

5. MAKE CLAIMS:

   - How is it doing it?
   - Why does it matter?

at the heart of Gatsby's dream while 
simultaneously seducing the reader into 
sharing that doomed romantic vision."

"Jane Eyre's journey from Lowood to Thornfield 
to Moor House traces her negotiation between 
passion and principle, ultimately arguing that 
true selfhood requires neither complete 
submission nor ruthless independence."

Through [specific technique/element],
[author] [verbs of analysis: reveals,
explores, critiques, examines] [thematic
insight], suggesting that [broader claim].
```

## 📝 Practice Analysis

### Sample Passage

```
FROM PRIDE AND PREJUDICE:

"It is a truth universally acknowledged, 
that a single man in possession of a 
good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

  just neighborhood gossip

  it's really the community's desire

TONE:
- Detached, amused narrator
- Satiric observation
- Austen's signature wit

FREE INDIRECT DISCOURSE:
- Sounds like narrator stating fact
- Actually voices community's view
- Reader shares the joke
