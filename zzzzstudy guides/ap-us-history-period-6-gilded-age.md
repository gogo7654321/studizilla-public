    Coal Mines
          ↓
    Railroads/Ships (transport)
          ↓
    Steel Mills
          ↓
    Sales/Distribution
    
    ALL OWNED BY CARNEGIE

          \         |         /
           ↓        ↓        ↓

## ✍️ Sample Short Answer Questions

### SAQ Example 1

**Briefly explain ONE way industrialization changed American society in the Gilded Age.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Industrialization transformed American labor by creating a new industrial working class subjected to dangerous conditions, long hours, and low pay. Unlike earlier artisans who controlled their work, industrial workers became interchangeable parts in factories, leading to the rise of labor unions like the Knights of Labor and AFL that organized workers to fight for better conditions through strikes and collective bargaining, though they faced fierce opposition from employers and government."

### SAQ Example 2

**Briefly explain ONE way that African Americans' status changed after Reconstruction AND ONE way it stayed the same.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Change: African Americans lost most political gains from Reconstruction as Southern states implemented disenfranchisement through poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. By 1900, Black voter registration had dropped dramatically (e.g., Louisiana from 130,000 to 1,342).

Continuity: African Americans continued to face economic exploitation as they remained trapped in the sharecropping system, bound to the land through debt and unable to acquire wealth or escape the agricultural economy, much as they had been under slavery."
