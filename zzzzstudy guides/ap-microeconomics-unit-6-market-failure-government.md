## 📈 Practice: Externality Correction

### Negative Externality Problem

| Given | |
|-------|--|
| **Private supply** | P = 2 + Q |
| **Social supply** | P = 2 + Q + 4 (external cost = 4) |
| **Demand** | P = 20 - Q |

| Solution | |
|----------|--|
| **Market Q** | 2 + Q = 20 - Q → Q = 9 |
| **Optimal Q** | 6 + Q = 20 - Q → Q = 7 |
| **Tax needed** | $4 per unit |

### Positive Externality Problem

| Given | |
|-------|--|
| **Private demand** | P = 20 - Q |
| **Social demand** | P = 24 - Q (external benefit = 4) |
| **Supply** | P = 2 + Q |

| Solution | |
|----------|--|
| **Market Q** | 20 - Q = 2 + Q → Q = 9 |
| **Optimal Q** | 24 - Q = 2 + Q → Q = 11 |
| **Subsidy needed** | $4 per unit |

**Good luck on your AP Microeconomics exam! 🍀💹**

Remember: Markets fail when externalities exist, public goods are needed, or information is asymmetric. Government can help through taxes, subsidies, and regulation, but government failure is also possible!

## 🏛️ Public Goods Deep Dive

### Why Markets Fail for Public Goods

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Free riding** | Can consume without paying |
| **No profit incentive** | Firms can't charge effectively |
| **Zero marginal cost** | Efficient to let everyone consume |
| **Underprovision** | Market provides too little |

### Optimal Provision of Public Goods

For public goods, ADD demand curves vertically (not horizontally):

| Concept | Private Goods | Public Goods |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Demand aggregation** | Horizontal (add quantities) | Vertical (add prices) |
| **Consumption** | Rival | Non-rival |
| **Exclusion** | Possible | Not possible |
| **Optimal condition** | P = MC | Sum of MB = MC |

## ⚖️ Coase Theorem in Practice

### Conditions for Coase Theorem

| Condition | Why Needed |
|-----------|------------|
| **Low transaction costs** | Negotiation must be cheap |
| **Clear property rights** | Someone must own the right |
| **Perfect information** | Both parties know costs/benefits |
| **Few parties** | Many parties = coordination problems |

### Coase Theorem Example

**Scenario**: Factory pollutes, affecting 10 nearby homes
- Pollution damage: $1,000 per home = $10,000 total
- Abatement cost for factory: $6,000

| Rights Assignment | Outcome |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Factory has right to pollute** | Homeowners pay factory $6,000-$10,000 to stop |
| **Homeowners have right to clean air** | Factory pays $6,000 to abate |
| **Either way** | Factory stops polluting (efficient outcome) |

### Real-World Complications

| Problem | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **High transaction costs** | Lawyers, time, uncertainty |
| **Holdout problem** | One party refuses to bargain |
| **Many parties** | Air pollution affects millions |
| **Unequal bargaining power** | Poor residents vs. wealthy corporation |

## 📉 Asymmetric Information Cases

### Adverse Selection Examples

| Market | Problem | Solution |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Health insurance** | Sick people more likely to buy | Mandatory coverage |
| **Used cars** | Sellers know defects | Warranties, inspections |
| **Credit markets** | Risky borrowers seek loans | Credit scores |

### Moral Hazard Examples

| Market | Problem | Solution |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Insurance** | Less careful when insured | Deductibles, co-pays |
| **Employment** | Workers may shirk | Monitoring, incentives |
| **Banking** | Too big to fail risk-taking | Capital requirements |

## 🎯 Extended FRQ Practice

### Problem 1: Complete Externality Analysis

A factory produces steel and also produces pollution. The private supply is P = 10 + Q, the demand is P = 50 - Q, and the external cost is $8 per unit.

(a) Find market equilibrium price and quantity
(b) Find socially optimal price and quantity
(c) Calculate deadweight loss at market equilibrium
(d) What tax would achieve the optimal outcome?

**Solutions**:
(a) Market: 10 + Q = 50 - Q → 2Q = 40 → Q = 20, P = $30

(b) Social supply: P = 18 + Q (add $8 external cost)
    18 + Q = 50 - Q → 2Q = 32 → Q = 16
    P = 50 - 16 = $34

(c) DWL = 0.5 × (Qm - Qs) × External Cost
    DWL = 0.5 × (20 - 16) × $8 = $16

(d) Tax = $8 per unit (equals external cost)

### Problem 2: Public Goods

Two consumers, A and B, value fireworks:
- A: P = 20 - Q
- B: P = 30 - Q
- MC = $35

Find optimal quantity.

**Solution**:
Vertical sum: P = (20 - Q) + (30 - Q) = 50 - 2Q
Set equal to MC: 50 - 2Q = 35
2Q = 15, Q* = 7.5 units
