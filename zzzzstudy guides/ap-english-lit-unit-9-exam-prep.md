## 📚 Sub-Theme 5: Literary Argument Essay (Q3)

### Understanding the Open Question

```
PROMPT STRUCTURE:
"Many works of literature feature 
[concept/element/situation]. Choose

analyzing how [element] contributes 
to an interpretation of the work 
as a whole."

```

### Sample Q3 Response Framework

```
PROMPT: Many works feature a character 
who must confront an uncomfortable 
truth about themselves. Choose a work...

THESIS:
"In The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway's 
gradual recognition of his own complicity 
in the tragedy—his awareness that his 
'tolerance' enabled rather than 
prevented destruction—forces readers 
to confront similar tendencies toward 
moral passivity."

BODY 1:
Nick's initial presentation of himself 
as non-judgmental observer
→ Show his self-characterization
→ Analyze what this masks

BODY 2:
Nick's active choices that enable Gatsby
→ Specific evidence
→ Analysis of moral evasion

BODY 3:
Nick's retrospective recognition

What the work suggests about 
self-knowledge and moral responsibility
