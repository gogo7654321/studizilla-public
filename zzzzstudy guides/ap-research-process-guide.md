## ❓ Phase 1: Developing Your Inquiry

### Finding a Topic

```
TOPIC SELECTION:

PERSONAL INTEREST:
What genuinely fascinates you?
What would you explore voluntarily?
What keeps you curious?

EXISTING KNOWLEDGE:
What do you already know?
What courses have inspired you?
What experiences inform this?

GAP IN KNOWLEDGE:
What don't researchers know yet?
What needs more investigation?
Where can you contribute?

FEASIBILITY:
Can you access needed sources?
Can you conduct needed research?
Is timeline realistic?
Do you have mentor support?
```

### From Topic to Question

```
QUESTION DEVELOPMENT:

START BROAD:
"Mental health in teenagers"

ADD FOCUS:
"Effects of exercise on teen mental health"

ADD SPECIFICITY:
"Relationship between regular physical 
activity and anxiety levels in high 
school students"

MAKE RESEARCHABLE:
"To what extent does participating in 
structured physical activity programs 
reduce self-reported anxiety levels 
among high school students compared 
to those who do not participate?"

TEST YOUR QUESTION:
□ Is it original (not already answered)?
□ Is it researchable (can gather data)?
□ Is it significant (matters)?
□ Is it focused (manageable scope)?
□ Is it complex (not yes/no)?
```

### Research Question Types

```
QUESTION FRAMEWORKS:

CAUSAL:
"What is the effect of X on Y?"
"To what extent does X cause Y?"

COMPARATIVE:
"How does X compare to Y in terms of Z?"
"What are the differences between...?"

CORRELATIONAL:
"What is the relationship between X and Y?"
"How does X relate to Y?"

EVALUATIVE:
"How effective is X at achieving Y?"
"What are the strengths and limitations of...?"

EXPLORATORY:
"What factors contribute to X?"
"How can X be understood through Y framework?"
```
