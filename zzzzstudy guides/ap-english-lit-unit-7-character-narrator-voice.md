# 🎭 AP English Literature Unit 7: Character, Narrator & Voice

## 📚 Unit Overview

This unit provides advanced study of how authors construct characters, deploy narrators, and develop distinctive voices to create meaning in literary works.

---

## 🎯 Sub-Theme 1: Character Construction

### Methods of Characterization

```
DIRECT CHARACTERIZATION:
Author explicitly tells us about character

"Tom was a cruel man who cared nothing 
for others' feelings."

Advantages:
- Clear, unambiguous
- Efficient

Limitations:
- Less engaging
- Tells rather than shows


INDIRECT CHARACTERIZATION (STEAL):

S - SPEECH:
    What/how character speaks
    Dialect, vocabulary, topics

T - THOUGHTS:
    Internal monologue
    Desires, fears, beliefs

E - EFFECTS ON OTHERS:
    How others react
    Reputation, relationships

A - ACTIONS:
    What character does
    Choices, behaviors

L - LOOKS:
    Physical appearance
    Clothing, expression
```

### Character Complexity

```
E.M. FORSTER'S CATEGORIES:

FLAT CHARACTERS:
- Built around single idea/quality
- Recognizable type
- Don't surprise us
- "Humorous" characters
- Often minor roles

Example: Mrs. Micawber
(always believes something will "turn up")

ROUND CHARACTERS:
- Complex, multi-faceted
- Capable of surprising us
- Change and develop
- Psychologically realistic
- Usually protagonists

Example: Elizabeth Bennet
(evolves from pride to self-knowledge)


STATIC vs. DYNAMIC:

STATIC:
- Remain essentially unchanged
- Not necessarily flat
- Can be complex but consistent

DYNAMIC:
- Undergo significant change
- Learn or transform
- Usually protagonists
```

### Character Functions

```
PROTAGONIST:
Central character; story focuses on them
- May be hero or antihero
- Pursues goals
- Faces obstacles

ANTAGONIST:
Opposes protagonist
- Not always evil
- Can be person, force, self
- Creates conflict

FOIL:
Contrasts with another character
- Highlights qualities through difference
- Same situation, different response
- Illuminates protagonist

CONFIDANT(E):
Character who hears others' thoughts
- Watson to Holmes
- Reader gains access to protagonist
- Vehicle for exposition

STOCK/ARCHETYPE:
Conventional character type
- The wise mentor
- The innocent
- The trickster
- Cultural familiarity
```

## 🗣️ Sub-Theme 2: Understanding Narrators

### Narrator vs. Author

```
CRITICAL DISTINCTION:

AUTHOR:
- Real person who wrote the text
- Has biographical existence
- Makes artistic choices
- Creates narrator

NARRATOR:
- Voice telling the story
- May be character or not
- Created by author
- Never simply "is" the author

Even in autobiography/memoir,
the "I" on the page is constructed.

IMPLIED AUTHOR:
- The "author" we construct from text
- Values and sensibility we infer
- May differ from real author
- "The author this text suggests"
```

### Types of Narrators

```
PARTICIPANT NARRATORS:

PROTAGONIST NARRATOR:
Tells their own story
- Jane Eyre, Great Expectations
- Most intimate access
- Limited to their knowledge

WITNESS NARRATOR:
Tells another's story
- Nick Carraway (Gatsby)
- Dr. Watson (Sherlock Holmes)
- Some distance from action
- Can observe protagonist

PERIPHERAL NARRATOR:
Minor participant
- Nelly Dean (Wuthering Heights)
- Limited direct involvement
- Observational role


NON-PARTICIPANT NARRATORS:

OMNISCIENT:
All-knowing, all-seeing
- Access to all minds
- Can move through time/space
- God-like perspective
- Victorian novels often

LIMITED OMNISCIENT:
Focused on one character's mind
- Third person but close
- Like camera following one person
- Free indirect discourse
- Modern novels often

OBJECTIVE/DRAMATIC:
Reports only external action
- No mind access
- Like camera
- Hemingway's style
- "Hills Like White Elephants"
```

### Focalization

```
WHO SEES vs. WHO SPEAKS:

NARRATOR:
The voice telling the story
WHO SPEAKS

FOCALIZER:
The perspective through which we see
WHO SEES

These can differ!

Example:
"Emma looked at Mr. Knightley. He seemed 
distressed, though she couldn't imagine why."

NARRATOR: Third person (author-like)
FOCALIZER: Emma (we see through her eyes)

TYPES OF FOCALIZATION:

ZERO FOCALIZATION:
Narrator knows more than characters
Omniscient

INTERNAL FOCALIZATION:
Narrator knows what one character knows
Limited

EXTERNAL FOCALIZATION:
Narrator knows less than characters
Objective, dramatic
```

---

## 🔮 Sub-Theme 3: Unreliable Narration

### What Makes a Narrator Unreliable?

```
UNRELIABLE NARRATOR:
One whose account we cannot fully trust

CAUSES OF UNRELIABILITY:

   - Madness
   - Trauma
   - Delusion
   Example: Poe's narrators

   - Rationalization
   - Ego protection
   Example: Stevens (Remains of the Day)

4. DELIBERATE DECEPTION:
   - Manipulation

   - Active interpretation required
   - More engaging than passive reception

3. IRONIC DISTANCE:
   - Author can critique narrator
   - Reader sees more than narrator
   - Complex moral positioning

4. THEMATIC DEPTH:
   - Truth vs. perception
   - Self-knowledge themes
   - Power of narrative

5. DRAMATIC IRONY:

Probably not, she thought. He never 
came when she needed him."

```
CHARACTER THESIS:

WEAK:
"Heathcliff is a complex character."
"Elizabeth Bennet changes in the novel."

STRONG:
"Heathcliff's transformation from 
sympathetic victim to cruel tormentor 
exposes how cycles of abuse perpetuate 
themselves, challenging readers to 
maintain sympathy for a protagonist 
who becomes monstrous."

"Elizabeth Bennet's evolution from 
prideful wit to humbled self-knowledge 
parallels Darcy's journey, suggesting 
that true love requires both parties 
to confront their flaws honestly."


VOICE/NARRATOR THESIS:

WEAK:
"The narrator is unreliable."
"The book uses first person."

STRONG:
"Stevens's meticulously formal 
narration in The Remains of the Day 
functions as a psychological defense 
mechanism, revealing through its very 
restraint the emotional devastation 
he cannot directly acknowledge."

"Through Nick Carraway's retrospective 
narration, Fitzgerald creates a 
perspective simultaneously seduced 
by and critical of Gatsby's dream, 
positioning readers to share Nick's 
impossible ambivalence."
```

## 📝 Practice Analysis

### Sample Character Analysis

```
CHARACTER: JAY GATSBY

DIRECT CHARACTERIZATION:
- Nick calls him "great"
- "Gorgeous" in personality
- Mysterious background

INDIRECT (STEAL):

SPEECH:
- "Old sport" catchphrase
- Carefully constructed manner
- Reveals Midwest origins

THOUGHTS:
- Not directly accessed
- Only through Nick's interpretation
- Dreams revealed through action

EFFECT ON OTHERS:
- Fascinates Nick
- Daisy attracted then retreats
- Rumors swirl around him

ACTIONS:
- Throws parties but doesn't enjoy them
- Accumulates wealth for Daisy
- Takes blame for Myrtle's death

LOOKS:
- Elaborate dress
- Carefully constructed appearance
- "Platonic conception of himself"

ANALYSIS:
Gatsby embodies self-invention and 
its limits. His characterization 
through others' eyes (we never access 
his thoughts directly) reinforces his 
status as projection and dream rather 
than fully knowable person.
```

### Sample Voice Analysis

```
PASSAGE - LOLITA OPENING:

"Lolita, light of my life, fire of 
my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: 
the tip of the tongue taking a trip 
of three steps down the palate to 
tap, at three, on the teeth."

ANALYSIS:

DICTION:
- Romantic, even reverent ("light of my life")
- Sensual ("fire of my loins")
- Linguistic ("palate," "tip of the tongue")

SYNTAX:
- Short declarations
- Rhythmic, almost poetic
- Careful, deliberate

SOUND:
- Alliteration ("light of my life")
- Attention to phonetics
- Musical quality

EFFECT:
- Beautiful, seductive prose
- Troubling given subject
- Narrator's sophistication evident
- Reader implicated in pleasure

UNRELIABILITY:
The gorgeous prose is weapon—
Humbert uses language to seduce reader 
as he seduced Lolita. Recognizing this 
is crucial to ethical reading.
