# 🧠 Attribution and Attitudes

## 🎯 What Is Social Psychology?

The study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another! 👥

### Key Topics

- Attribution (explaining behavior)
- Attitudes and persuasion
- Conformity and obedience
- Group behavior
- Prejudice and discrimination
- Aggression and attraction

---

## 📋 Attribution Theory

### What Is Attribution?

How we explain the causes of behavior—our own and others'.

### Types of Attributions

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Dispositional (Internal)** | Person's traits, personality | "She failed because she's lazy" |
| **Situational (External)** | Environmental factors | "She failed because the test was unfair" |

---

## ⚠️ Attribution Errors

### Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)

| Definition | Overestimate dispositional; underestimate situational |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Example | Assume rude waiter is a rude person (not having a bad day) |
| Also called | Correspondence bias |

### Why It Happens

- Person is salient (stands out)
- Situation is often invisible
- Cognitive efficiency

---

## 🔄 Actor-Observer Bias

| When You Are... | Attribution |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Actor** (doing it) | Situational ("I failed because the test was hard") |
| **Observer** (watching) | Dispositional ("They failed because they're dumb") |

### Why?

- We know our own situation
- We see others' behavior, not their circumstances

---

## 😊 Self-Serving Bias

| Success | Failure |
|---------|---------|
| Internal attribution | External attribution |
| "I aced it because I'm smart" | "I failed because of the bad teacher" |

### Why?

- Protects self-esteem
- Maintains positive self-image

---

## 🌍 Cultural Differences

| Culture | Tendency |
|---------|----------|
| **Individualistic** (Western) | More FAE; focus on individual |
| **Collectivistic** (Eastern) | More situational attributions |

---

## 💭 Attitudes

### Definition

Beliefs and feelings that predispose responses to objects, people, and events.

### Three Components (ABC)

| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **A**ffective | Emotional | "I love dogs" |
| **B**ehavioral | Actions | "I pet dogs" |
| **C**ognitive | Beliefs | "Dogs are loyal" |

---

## 🔄 Attitude Formation

### Sources of Attitudes

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Direct experience | Bitten by dog → fear dogs |
| Observational learning | Parents fear spiders → you fear spiders |
| Conditioning | Pairing product with positive images |
| Social/cultural | Cultural norms shape attitudes |

---

## 🔀 Attitude-Behavior Relationship

### When Do Attitudes Predict Behavior?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Strong attitudes | Better predictor |
| Specific attitudes | Better predictor |
| Accessible attitudes | Better predictor |
| Social pressure | Can override attitudes |

---

## 🎭 Cognitive Dissonance

### Leon Festinger's Theory

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Cognitive dissonance** | Discomfort from conflicting thoughts/behaviors |
| **Resolution** | Change attitude or behavior |

### Classic Study

| Participants | Paid $1 or $20 to lie (say boring task was fun) |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| $1 group | Changed attitude ("It was actually okay") |
| $20 group | No attitude change ("I lied for money") |
| Explanation | $1 = insufficient justification → change attitude |

### Diagram

    └───── ≠ ───────┘
           │
    DISSONANCE
           │
    Change one to match
```

---

## 📢 Persuasion

### Elaboration Likelihood Model

| Route | When Used | Method | Lasting? |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Central** | Motivated, able to think | Strong arguments | Yes |
| **Peripheral** | Not motivated/able | Cues (attractiveness, celebrity) | Less |

### Persuasion Techniques

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Foot-in-the-door** | Small request → big request | Sign petition → donate |
| **Door-in-the-face** | Big request (refused) → small request | Donate $100 (no) → donate $10 (yes) |
| **Low-ball** | Commit first, then add costs | Agree to price, then add fees |

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| FAE | Overestimate disposition |
| Actor-observer | Actor = situational; Observer = dispositional |
| Self-serving | Success = internal; Failure = external |
| Cognitive dissonance | Inconsistency → discomfort |
| Central route | Thinking carefully → lasting change |
| Foot-in-the-door | Small → big request |

## 🔬 Asch's Conformity Experiments

### Procedure

| Element | Description |

| Never conformed | ~25% |

### Diagram

```
Standard Line     Comparison Lines
    │
    │                A    B    C
    │               ─    ───  ──
    │
    │             (B is correct)
```

Confederates say "C" — will participant conform?

| Showed signs of distress | Many |
| Wanted to stop | Most |
| But obeyed | When experimenter insisted |

### The Setup

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Experimenter    Teacher    Learner  │

## ✍️ Sample MC Questions

### Question 1

When we attribute our own failures to situational factors but others' failures to dispositional factors, we are demonstrating:

(A) Fundamental attribution error
(B) Actor-observer bias
(C) Self-serving bias
(D) Just-world phenomenon

**Answer: (B)** Actor-observer bias explains different attributions for self vs. others.

### Question 2

In Asch's conformity studies, participants were most likely to conform when:

(A) The group was very small
(B) The group gave unanimous wrong answers
(C) They could respond privately
(D) The task was very easy

**Answer: (B)** Unanimity increased conformity; one dissenter reduced it.

### Question 3

Milgram's obedience studies showed that:

(A) Most people refuse to harm others under authority pressure
(B) Only disturbed individuals obey destructive orders
(C) Ordinary people can be influenced to harm others
(D) Education prevents blind obedience

**Answer: (C)** 65% of ordinary people gave maximum shock when ordered.

### Question 4

The tendency to think that everyone else in a group shares your opinion when no one speaks up is called:

(A) Group polarization
(B) Groupthink
(C) Pluralistic ignorance
(D) Social loafing

**Answer: (C)** Pluralistic ignorance - assuming silence means agreement.

### Question 5

According to the mere exposure effect:

(A) We dislike things we see frequently
(B) Repeated exposure increases liking
(C) First impressions are most important
(D) Physical attractiveness determines liking

**Answer: (B)** Mere exposure - familiarity leads to increased liking.

---

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: A student notices that classmates don't offer to help a struggling peer during group work. Explain how each of the following concepts from social psychology might account for this:

(a) Diffusion of responsibility
(b) Pluralistic ignorance
(c) Bystander effect
(d) Social loafing

**Answer**:

(a) **Diffusion of responsibility**: With multiple classmates present, each individual feels less personal responsibility to help. The responsibility is "diffused" among all group members, so each person thinks "someone else will help" or "it's not solely my job." If only one person witnessed the struggling peer, that individual would feel more obligated to assist.

(b) **Pluralistic ignorance**: Each classmate privately notices the struggling peer may need help but looks to others to determine if action is needed. When they see no one else helping, they incorrectly assume that the situation must not require intervention or that others don't think it's a problem. Everyone privately thinks help might be needed, but no one acts because no one else is acting.

(c) **Bystander effect**: The presence of multiple bystanders (classmates) reduces the likelihood that any individual will help. Research by Latané and Darley shows that as the number of bystanders increases, the probability of any one person helping decreases. If only one classmate were present, they would be more likely to help.

(d) **Social loafing**: In the group work context, individuals may reduce their effort because their individual contributions are less identifiable. The struggling peer's need for help becomes everyone's problem but no one's specific responsibility. Each person may assume others are handling it, leading to less overall effort to assist.
