# 💹 Unit 5: Factor Markets

## 📋 Unit Overview

Factor markets (or resource markets) are where firms buy the inputs they need for production. This unit focuses on labor markets, wages, and how income is distributed! 💼

### Why Factor Markets Matter

| Importance | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Income determination** | Your wages come from factor markets |
| **Resource allocation** | How labor and capital flow to uses |
| **Efficiency** | Productive resources where most valued |
| **Inequality** | Distribution of income across workers |

### Essential Questions

| Question | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| How are wages determined? | Supply and demand for labor |
| What is marginal revenue product? | Value of worker to firm |
| How do firms hire workers? | MRP = MRC rule |
| What affects labor supply? | Worker decisions |
| What causes wage differences? | Skill, discrimination, unions |

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Derived demand** | Demand for inputs comes from demand for outputs |
| **MRP** | Marginal Revenue Product |
| **MRC** | Marginal Resource Cost |
| **Wage** | Price of labor |

---

## 🔄 Derived Demand

### What Is Derived Demand?

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Demand for inputs derived from demand for outputs |
| **Example** | Demand for auto workers comes from demand for cars |
| **Key insight** | Input demand depends on output market |

### Implications

| Relationship | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| **Output demand ↑** | Labor demand ↑ |
| **Output price ↑** | Labor demand ↑ |
| **Output demand ↓** | Labor demand ↓ |

---

## 💰 Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)

### Definition

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MRP** | Additional revenue from hiring one more worker |
| **Formula** | MRP = MP × MR |
| **In perfect competition** | MRP = MP × P (since MR = P) |

### MRP Formula

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MRP = MP × MR** | General formula |
| **MRP = MP × P** | In competitive output market |
| **MPL** | Marginal product of labor |

### MRP Curve

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shape** | Downward sloping |
| **Why** | Diminishing marginal returns |
| **As more hired** | MP falls → MRP falls |
| **IS the firm's demand** | For labor (in perfect competition) |

### Why MRP Declines

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Diminishing MP** | Each worker adds less output |
| **Same price** | But less product per worker |
| **Result** | Less revenue from each additional worker |

---

## 📊 Marginal Resource Cost (MRC)

### Definition

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MRC** | Additional cost of hiring one more worker |
| **In competitive labor market** | MRC = wage |
| **Why** | Firm is wage taker |

### Competitive Labor Market

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Many firms hiring** | Many workers seeking jobs |
| **Wage taker** | Firm takes market wage |
| **Supply of labor** | Horizontal to firm |
| **MRC = wage** | Constant |

---

## ✅ Profit Maximizing Hiring Rule

### The Rule

| Rule | MRP = MRC |
|------|-----------|
| **If MRP > MRC** | Hire more workers |
| **If MRP < MRC** | Hire fewer workers |
| **At MRP = MRC** | Optimal employment |

### In Competitive Labor Market

| Since | MRC = wage |
|-------|------------|
| **Rule becomes** | MRP = W |
| **Hire until** | MRP of last worker = wage |

### Graphical Analysis

| Curve | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **MRP curve** | Downward sloping |
| **Wage line** | Horizontal at market wage |
| **Intersection** | Optimal quantity of labor |

---

## 📉 Demand for Labor

### Shifts in Labor Demand

| Factor | Effect on Labor Demand |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Output price ↑** | Demand ↑ (MRP = MP × P) |
| **Productivity ↑** | Demand ↑ (MP rises) |
| **Price of capital** | Depends on substitute/complement |
| **# of firms** | More firms → market demand ↑ |

### Capital and Labor

| Relationship | Effect of Capital Price ↑ |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Substitutes** | Labor demand ↑ |
| **Complements** | Labor demand ↓ |

---

## 📈 Supply of Labor

### Individual Labor Supply

| **Higher wage** | More work (usually) |
| **Backward bending** | At very high wages |

### Backward Bending Supply

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Substitution effect** | Higher wage → work more |
| **Income effect** | Higher income → want more leisure |
| **At low wages** | Substitution dominates → upward sloping |
| **At high wages** | Income dominates → backward bending |

### Market Labor Supply

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Upward sloping** | Higher wage → more workers enter |
| **Aggregate** | Sum of individual supplies |

### Shifts in Labor Supply

| Factor | Effect on Labor Supply |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Immigration** | Supply ↑ |
| **Population growth** | Supply ↑ |
| **Preferences for work** | Supply changes |
| **Non-labor income** | ↑ income → supply ↓ |
| **Alternative wages** | Higher elsewhere → supply ↓ |

---

## ⚖️ Labor Market Equilibrium

### Equilibrium

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Equilibrium wage** | Where supply = demand |
| **Equilibrium employment** | Quantity at that wage |
| **Market clears** | No shortage or surplus |

### Changes in Equilibrium

| Change | Effect on Wage | Effect on Employment |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Demand ↑** | Wage ↑ | Employment ↑ |
| **Demand ↓** | Wage ↓ | Employment ↓ |
| **Supply ↑** | Wage ↓ | Employment ↑ |
| **Supply ↓** | Wage ↑ | Employment ↓ |

### Complete MRP Calculation Table

| Workers | Total Product | Marginal Product | Price | Total Revenue | MRP |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------|---------------|-----|
| 0 | 0 | - | $10 | $0 | - |
| 1 | 20 | 20 | $10 | $200 | $200 |

### Factor Market Comparison Summary

| Feature | Perfect Competition | Monopsony | Union |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| **# of employers** | Many | One | Many |
| **# of sellers** | Many | Many | One (union) |
| **Wage** | Market determined | Below MRP | Above market |
| **Employment** | Where MRP = W | Where MRP = MRC | Depends on strength |
| **Efficiency** | Allocatively efficient | DWL from underhiring | DWL from wage floor |

### The Bilateral Monopoly Case

When a union faces a monopsony employer:
- Union pushes for higher wages (upward)
- Monopsony pushes for lower wages (downward)
- Outcome depends on bargaining power
- Can actually INCREASE employment toward competitive level!

## 💡 Human Capital Theory Deep Dive

### Investment in Human Capital

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Formal education** | School, college, degrees | College degree, certifications |
| **On-the-job training** | Skills learned at work | Apprenticeships, internships |
| **Experience** | Learning by doing | Years in industry |

## 🎯 FRQ Practice Problems

### Problem 1: MRP and Hiring

A firm sells widgets in a perfectly competitive market at $8 per widget. The marginal product schedule is:

| Workers | MP |
|---------|-----|
| 1 | 30 |
| 2 | 25 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 15 |
| 5 | 10 |

(a) Calculate MRP for each worker
(b) If W = $120, how many workers hired?
(c) If W increases to $180, what happens?

**Solutions**:
(a) MRP = MP × P
- Worker 1: 30 × $8 = $240
- Worker 2: 25 × $8 = $200
- Worker 3: 20 × $8 = $160
- Worker 4: 15 × $8 = $120
- Worker 5: 10 × $8 = $80

(b) Hire where MRP ≥ W: At W = $120, hire 4 workers (MRP4 = $120)

(c) At W = $180: Hire 2 workers (MRP2 = $200 > $180, MRP3 = $160 < $180)

### Problem 2: Monopsony Analysis

Draw a properly labeled graph showing a monopsony labor market:

**Answer Key Points**:
- MRC curve above SL curve
- Monopsony hires where MRP = MRC
- Pays wage from SL curve (lower)
- Employment: Lm < Lc
- Wage: Wm < Wc
- DWL: triangle between curves from Lm to Lc
