| Problem | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| N₀ = 100, r = 0.05. Find N after 10 years (exponential). | N = 100 × e^(0.05×10) = **165** |
| K = 1000, N = 200, r = 0.1. Calculate dN/dt (logistic). | dN/dt = 0.1 × 200 × (800/1000) = **16** |

### Mark-Recapture Problems

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| M = 50, C = 60, R = 15 | N = (50 × 60)/15 = **200** |
