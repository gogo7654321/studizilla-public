# 👁️ Principles of Sensation

## 🎯 Sensation vs. Perception

### Key Distinction

| Process | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Sensation** | Detection of stimuli | Light hits retina |
| **Perception** | Interpretation of stimuli | "I see a red apple" |

### The Process

```
Stimulus → Sensation → Perception → Recognition
  (Light)   (Detection)  (Organization)  (Meaning)
```

---

## 📊 Transduction

### Converting Energy to Neural Signals

| Sense | Stimulus | Receptor | Transduction |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Vision | Light waves | Rods, cones | Light → Neural signal |
| Hearing | Sound waves | Hair cells | Vibration → Neural signal |
| Touch | Pressure | Mechanoreceptors | Pressure → Neural signal |
| Taste | Chemicals | Taste buds | Chemical → Neural signal |
| Smell | Chemicals | Olfactory receptors | Chemical → Neural signal |

---

## 🔬 Thresholds

### Absolute Threshold

The **minimum** stimulation needed to detect a stimulus **50%** of the time.

| Sense | Absolute Threshold Example |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Vision | Candle flame 30 miles away (clear night) |
| Hearing | Ticking watch 20 feet away (quiet) |
| Smell | Drop of perfume in 3-room apartment |
| Taste | Teaspoon of sugar in 2 gallons water |
| Touch | Wing of bee on cheek from 1 cm |

### Difference Threshold (JND)

The **minimum difference** between two stimuli that can be detected **50%** of the time.

Also called **Just Noticeable Difference (JND)**

---

## 📐 Weber's Law

### The Formula

$$\frac{\Delta I}{I} = k$$

Where:
- $\Delta I$ = Change in intensity
- $I$ = Original intensity
- $k$ = Constant (varies by sense)

### What It Means

The JND is a **constant proportion** of the original stimulus.

| Sense | Weber's Constant (k) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Weight | ~2% (lift 50 lbs, notice 1 lb change) |
| Light | ~8% |
| Sound | ~5% |

### Example

- Original weight: 100 lbs → JND = 2 lbs
- Original weight: 50 lbs → JND = 1 lb

**Heavier starting weight = larger JND needed**

---

## 📉 Sensory Adaptation

### Getting Used to Stimuli

| Definition | Reduced sensitivity after constant stimulation |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Purpose | Focus on changes in environment |
| Example | Not feeling your watch after a while |

### Examples

| Sense | Adaptation Example |
|-------|-------------------|
| Smell | Stop smelling your own perfume |
| Touch | Don't feel clothes on skin |
| Vision | Eyes adjust to dark room |
| Taste | Food tastes less intense over time |

### Why It Matters

- Helps us detect **changes** (what's important!)
- Constant stimuli become background "noise"

---

## 🔊 Signal Detection Theory

### Beyond Simple Thresholds

Detection depends on:
- **Signal strength**
- **Background noise**
- **Psychological factors** (expectations, motivation)

### Four Outcomes

|  | Signal Present | Signal Absent |
|--|----------------|---------------|
| **"Yes"** | ✅ Hit | ❌ False Alarm |
| **"No"** | ❌ Miss | ✅ Correct Rejection |

### Example: Radiologist Reading X-rays

- Hit: Detects cancer that exists
- Miss: Fails to detect cancer
- False Alarm: Says cancer when none exists
- Correct Rejection: Correctly says no cancer

---

## ⬆️ Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processing

### Two Ways to Process

| Type | Direction | Driven By |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Bottom-up** | Stimulus → Perception | Raw sensory data |
| **Top-down** | Knowledge → Perception | Experience, expectations |

### Examples

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Bottom-up | Reading unfamiliar letters |
| Top-down | Filling in missing letters in wrds |

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Absolute threshold | 50% detection rate |
| JND | Minimum detectable difference |
| Weber's Law | JND is constant proportion |
| Sensory adaptation | Decreasing response to constant stimulus |
| Signal detection | Psychology affects detection |

# 👁️ Vision

## 🔬 The Eye Structure

### Parts of the Eye

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Cornea** | Clear outer layer; bends light |
| **Pupil** | Opening that lets light in |
| **Iris** | Colored part; controls pupil size |
| **Lens** | Focuses light on retina |
| **Retina** | Contains photoreceptors |
| **Fovea** | Central focus point; clearest vision |
| **Optic nerve** | Sends signals to brain |
| **Blind spot** | Where optic nerve exits (no receptors) |

### Eye Diagram

```
Light →  Cornea → Pupil → Lens → Retina
              ↓                    ↓
            Iris              Rods & Cones

## 📊 Visual Processing Pathway

### From Eye to Brain

```
Light → Retina → Rods/Cones → Bipolar cells → Ganglion cells
                                                    ↓
                                              Optic Nerve
                                                    ↓
                                              Thalamus
                                                    ↓
                                         Visual Cortex (Occipital)
```

### Feature Detectors

| Type | Responds To |
|------|-------------|
| Simple cells | Lines at specific angles |
| Complex cells | Moving lines |
| Hypercomplex cells | Corners, shapes |

---

## 🌈 Color Vision

### Two Major Theories

### 1. Trichromatic Theory (Young-Helmholtz)

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Three cone types | Red, Green, Blue |
| Color mixing | Combinations create all colors |
| Location | Works in retina |

### 2. Opponent-Process Theory (Hering)

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Three opponent pairs | Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, Black-White |
| Explains | Afterimages |
| Location | Works in neural pathways |

### Which Is Right?

**BOTH!** They work at different stages of processing.

- Trichromatic: At retina (cones)
- Opponent-process: At ganglion cells and beyond

### Why More Common in Males?

- Color genes on X chromosome
- Males have one X (XY)
- Females have two X (XX) - backup copy

---

## 👓 Visual Problems

### Common Vision Issues

| Problem | Cause | Correction |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Nearsightedness (myopia)** | Eyeball too long | Concave lens |

|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Sweet** | Sugars | Energy source |
| **Salty** | Sodium | Electrolytes |
| **Sour** | Acids | Spoiled food |
| **Bitter** | Toxins | Poison warning |
| **Umami** | Proteins | Nutrition |

### Taste Pathway

```
Chemicals → Taste buds (papillae) → Cranial nerves → Thalamus → Gustatory cortex
```

### Sensory Interaction

Taste + smell + texture + temperature = **Flavor**!

---

## 👃 Smell (Olfaction)

### Olfactory System

# 🧩 Perceptual Organization

## 🔮 Gestalt Principles Review

### "The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts"

| Principle | Rule | Visual |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Figure-ground** | Distinguish object from background | 🏺 or 👤👤? |
| **Proximity** | Near things grouped | ●● ●● |
| **Similarity** | Similar things grouped | ●●○○ |
| **Continuity** | See smooth paths | ↗️ not zigzags |
| **Closure** | Complete incomplete figures | △ from lines |
| **Common fate** | Things moving together grouped | 🐦🐦🐦→ |

---

## 📐 Perceptual Constancies

### Stable Perception Despite Change

| Constancy | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Size constancy** | Objects seem same size at different distances | Friend looks same size near/far |
| **Shape constancy** | Objects keep shape from different angles | Door still rectangular |
| **Color constancy** | Colors look same in different lighting | White shirt looks white indoors/outdoors |
| **Brightness constancy** | Brightness stable despite lighting | Coal looks black even in sun |

---

## 🎭 Perceptual Set

### Expectations Shape Perception

| Factor | How It Affects Perception |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Context** | Same stimulus perceived differently |
| **Motivation** | Hungry people see food |
| **Emotion** | Anxious people see threats |
| **Culture** | Cultural experiences shape interpretation |

### Classic Example

```
    1 3
    
    A B C
    
Is the middle one B or 13?
Context determines perception!
```

---

## 👀 Attention

### Selective Attention

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cocktail party effect** | Hear your name across a noisy room |
| **Inattentional blindness** | Miss obvious things when focused elsewhere |
| **Change blindness** | Fail to notice changes in scenes |

### Inattentional Blindness Example

The "invisible gorilla" experiment:
- Count basketball passes
- Miss person in gorilla suit walking through!

---

## 🎢 Motion Perception

### Types of Motion Perception

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Real motion** | Actual movement | Car driving |
| **Apparent motion** | Illusion of movement | Movie frames; lights |
| **Induced motion** | Stationary object seems to move | Moon "moving" past clouds |

### Stroboscopic Motion

Rapid sequence of images = perceived motion (movies, animations)

---

## 🌀 Perceptual Illusions

### Why Do Illusions Work?

Our brain uses shortcuts that can be tricked!

| Illusion | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Müller-Lyer** | Lines look different lengths (arrows) |
| **Ponzo** | Upper line looks longer (railroad tracks) |
| **Ames room** | People look different sizes |
| **Moon illusion** | Moon looks bigger on horizon |

### What Illusions Teach Us

- Perception is **constructed**
- Brain uses **context**
- Our shortcuts can be **fooled**

---

## 🧠 Top-Down Processing Examples

### Context Shapes Perception

| Example | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| Reading | Fill in missing letters |
| Faces | Recognize familiar faces easily |
| Music | Hear expected melody |
| Language | Understand accented speech |

---

## 🌍 Cultural Influences on Perception

### Perception Varies by Culture

| Finding | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Müller-Lyer illusion less effective in some cultures | Less exposure to "carpentered" environments |
| Depth perception differences | Experience with art, photography |
| Holistic vs. analytic perception | Cultural thinking styles |

---

## 🎯 AP Exam Tips

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| Gestalt | Brain organizes into wholes |
| Constancies | Perception stays stable |

## ✍️ Sample Free Response

**Question**: John is at a loud party and trying to have a conversation.

(a) Explain how **sensory adaptation** allows John to have a conversation despite the loud music.

(b) Explain how **selective attention** helps John focus on his friend's voice.

(c) Using **signal detection theory**, explain factors that might affect John's ability to hear his friend.

(d) Explain how **the cocktail party effect** demonstrates John's attentional abilities.

**Answer**:

(a) **Sensory adaptation**: Over time, John's auditory system becomes less sensitive to the constant background music. This allows his attention to shift to new or changing stimuli (like his friend's voice) rather than the unchanging loud music.

(b) **Selective attention**: John's brain filters out irrelevant sensory information (background noise, other conversations) to focus on his friend's voice. His attention acts like a spotlight, enhancing processing of selected stimuli while diminishing awareness of unselected stimuli.

(c) **Signal detection theory**: John's ability to detect his friend's voice depends on:
- **Signal strength**: How loud his friend speaks
- **Noise level**: Background music and other conversations
- **Psychological state**: John's motivation to hear (high motivation = more hits, but also more false alarms)
- **Expectations**: If John expects certain words, he may perceive them more easily

(d) **Cocktail party effect**: Even while focused on his conversation, John would likely notice if someone across the room said his name. This demonstrates that we unconsciously monitor unattended stimuli and will shift attention when something personally relevant appears.
